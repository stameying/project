      <text xml:space="preserve">Sunday, June 10, 3:55 PM -- There is, I maintain, something wrong with an
entry in an encyclopedia that consists merely of a list of the senses of a
word.  Some people either disagree with, or simply do not understand, this
view.  So I think it needs some clarification and defense.  That's what I'll
do today.

I think it is obvious that Wikipedia (like encyclopedias generally) is not
in the business ''simply'' of giving dictionary definitions.  But you might
find something paradoxical about this.  Isn't the meaning of a word one of
the most important pieces of information there is about it?  So surely
Wikipedia--like encyclopedias generally--''must'' give dictionary
definitions.  This is a good objection, and replying to it will help to
clarify my position.

When we define a word in an encyclopedia entry, we explain what the word
means ''in order to'' be well-positioned say more about it in the
encyclopedia entry.  In other words, we have a ''reason'' to define the
word, and that is to let people know precisely what we are talking about in
an encyclopedia entry.

Now consider this: when someone lists a bunch of the senses of a word,
giving definitions for each, just as a dictionary would, what purpose does
that list of definitions have ''for an encyclopedia''?  If it has ''any''
purpose at all, as far as I can see, it would be clarify the topics of so
many (different, if closely related) encyclopedia articles.

But the word, in ''many'' of the senses listed, is simply not the ''name
of'' a topic for an encyclopedia articles.  For example, I might create an
article called [[run]] that lists the zillion different senses this English
word has; one of the senses would be &quot;to operate (e.g., machinery).&quot;  Now,
if we have an article on [[machinery operation]] (and why not??), it surely
will not be listed under the word &quot;run&quot;!  It will be listed under something
relatively ''[[precision|precise]],'' like &quot;machinery operation.&quot;

So here is my argument.  The purpose of writing for an encyclopedia is to
create encyclopedia articles.  Encyclopedia articles, whatever else they are
or are not supposed to be, are not ''merely'' dictionary definitions.  That
is, in order to be proper encyclopedia articles, they will contain ''some''
non-semantic (&quot;synthetic,&quot; if you will) information about the subject of the
article.  Now, in an encyclopedia, the main (perhaps not the ''only'')
reason to define a word is to clarify the topic of an encyclopedia entry.
But the practice of, in place of a proper encyclopedia entry, listing out
many different senses of a word has in English, inevitably leads to the
listing of very many definitions that are ''not'' topics of encyclopedia
entries.  I think there's no place for that in an encyclopedia.

This is pretty much my main reason for disliking encyclopedia entries that
consist just of lists of senses of a word.  Of course, when each sense
listed is the subject of an article, I suppose, the list might have
considerable use.  See, for example, [[liberal]].

Well, my time's up.  :-)

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----------
I reckon, as you say, that just listing the meanings (or single meaning) of a word is not an encyclopedia article. But i reckon Wikipedia needs some of these anyway. I can think of two cases where this would really enhance the encyclopedia (there may be more):

1. Where an article uses lots of jargon words that might not be known to a reasonably educated person who is not familiar with that field, it would be best to hotlink each jargon word to a definition. If a proper encyclopedia article can be written about the word, then do it, but otherwise just a brief definition for the rest of us would be very useful. (example, [[paraphyletic]] and similar words on some of the biology pages.) Alternatively, paraphyletic could link to [[Biology/strange words and jargon]], which would make quite a reasonable encyplopedia article, but then the reader would have to scroll or search down to the word they are interested in, so just having a simple definition page for each word would be more useful to the average reader.

2. As Larry notes, where a word has several meanings, at least one of which could reasonably have an article written on it, it might be worth having a small &quot;glue&quot; page just listing the various meanings, BUT in this case it must have hotlinks to articles for at least some of the different meanings.

Does this make sense? [[Geronimo Jones]]
----
Yes, and I agree with both points.  I don't think it contradicts anything I said, however. :-) --[[LMS]]
----
I think the one line definitions are not going away, as the
pages with lots of personal views didn't so I propose the
same solution: create a wikipedia/Dictionary, where the
one liners can go. The definition that merits a encyclopedia
entry will have a link to that article. If somebody puts a
dictionary entry in the encyclopedia, instead of erase it or
just watch in impotence, we can move it to the dictionary.
Would that be too terrible, Larry?
--AstroNomer 
----
I see the &quot;definition&quot; pages as seeds which will eventually grow full articles.  If they don't, it will only be because no contributor felt either moved or competent to expand on the bare bones defintion.  Bunches of the articles I have contributed started on someone else's, or my own, conclusory definition page.  Why is it so important to discourage this?
----
One-line definitions are not the subject of this column.  I think they have their place.  I am complaining about lists of the senses of words, some of which are not the subjects of encyclopedia articles.  ''Those'' pages are just taking up space; they won't become articles unless someone deletes most of them and replaces them with a proper article or two. --[[LMS]]
----
I recently ran into a problem, and I'm hoping that I handled it correctly.  An existing article at [[w:Nebuchadnezzar]] redirected to [[w:Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylonia]].  However, there are two other important uses of that term.  
*The first is Morpheus's rogue vessel in &quot;The Matrix&quot; (A google for the term 'nebuchadnezzar' will bring up this as the second hit).  
*The second is a large bottle of champagne, equivalent to 15 normal bottles of champagne.  This is a widely used term in wine circles (although most casual drinkers never order more than a magnum - 2 bottles).  
I created, a disambiguation page of sorts, which is essentially, as you say, a list of the senses of the word, that provided a link to the babylonian king at the top.  However, the other two do not exist as articles in the wikipedia, and I fear that any article on either topic would be a stub at best.  While I know that it is more common to apply these stub definitions at the bottom of an article page (as seen in the article for [[w:Beck]]), I did not think it would be appropriate to have these definitions on the page for [[w:Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylonia]], as they are only for the word Nebuchadnezzar.  What would your solution be in this case?  If I am not clear enough about the problem, let me know.  Thank You -[[User:DropDeadGorgias|DropDeadGorgias]] 18:53 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tuesday, June 12, 1:03 PM -- I am suspicious of [[subpages]].  Often, I don't much like them.  My basic reason is philosophically interesting, I think.  It is ''not'' because I am opposed to conceptual hierarchies.  (I like those!  They're interesting!)  So what is the reason?

For the purposes of this discussion, let's speak of &quot;main pages&quot; and &quot;subpages,&quot; as well as &quot;main topics&quot; and &quot;subtopics.&quot;  If I create &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Alaska/Anchorage]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then I make &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Anchorage]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; a subpage (of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Alaska]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and the topic, Anchorage, is (as I will explain) ''treated as'' a subtopic (of Alaska).  Moreover, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Alaska]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the main page, and Alaska is  ''treated as'' the main topic.

Usually, when a topic explained on a subpage of a main page, it is ''also'' treated as a sub''topic'' of a main topic (where the main topic is, of course, the topic of the main page).  Exactly how the topic is &quot;treated&quot; as a subtopic is an inexact matter, I suppose having to do with psychology and probability.  If I see that &quot;XYZ&quot; is made a subpage of &quot;ABC&quot;, then, ''probably,'' it will seem to me that I am invited to consider the topic XYZ as ''an aspect of'' ABC as a more general topic.

Anchorage is definitely an Alaskan city, and no ''false information'' is conveyed by treating Anchorage as a subtopic of Alaska.  So that's not the problem.  The problem is that Anchorage is not ''merely'' an Alaskan city: it is also an American city; it is also a city of Alaska's south-central region; it is a city of the far north; it is a very new city; it is an earthquake-prone city; etc.  There are very many different categorizations of topics that are possible, each of them correct, but each of them also--in its own usually innocuous way--as prejudicial as the next.

Almost ''every'' topic we might find can be regarded as a subtopic of some other topic.  Perhaps the topics &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;item&quot; are the exceptions (if we can talk about nonexistent and even impossible things and items).  Alaska itself is an American state.  Shall we then create &lt;nowiki&gt;[[States of the U.S.A./Alaska]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;?  Shall we make &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Number/1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;--but if so, why not &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Universal/Number]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;?

But in some cases--e.g., the [[Poker]] pages--the use of subpages seems to be justified and helpful.  So why ''is'' that?  And what would distinguish the poker pages from other pages?  I think it's because everything that Lee Crocker has put in his poker pages is, after all, ''about poker,'' and--more importantly--is not about anything else.  All of those subpages really are ''best thought of'' and considered in the context of the game of poker.  This situation is more the exception than the rule.  But I can imagine other sets of subpages, for example, for [[Dungeons and Dragons]], for [[Star Wars]], and for many other topics about which there is much detail, but it is all detail ''best considered in the single context of the main topic.''  There isn't any particularly good reason to consider &quot;Jabba the Hut&quot; apart from the [[Star Wars]] universe; there isn't much use to talking about &quot;Texas Hold 'Em&quot; outside the context of poker (I guess--not knowing too much about poker).

There are, of course, other very good reasons ''not'' to use subpages.  But the above is a rough explanation of why I am &quot;philosophically&quot; opposed to them.  I could go on, but I'm out of time.  :-)

----

P.S. This very article appears on a subpage.  Oh, the irony!

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----

The difficulty is though that wiki operates on very limited name space, and name clashes are going to be inevitable. Subpages provide a system somewhat like dewey decimal, which can be subcategories arbitarily. The problem that you are describing arises because of the granularity of the linking scheme. Pages have to be a certain size or the become unreadable (and the wikipedia becomes wikidictionary). So it is likely that an article will cover several topics. The problem is that you can not link to parts of the article. If you could then the Anchorage article could still be linked from Alaska, but you would link in only that section which related to Anchorage as an Alaskan city. 





Ultimately you are trying to model an semantically complex problem, with a trivial modelling scheme (which is wiki linking model). In the end you get lots of ad hoc solutions arising, none of them very satisfying...[[Phil Lord]]


----


Agreed, but the simplest solution, which is probably the best we'll be able to do, is forthcoming: the use of parentheses in titles.  Then we'll be able to write [[Nirvana (rock band)]] and [[Nirvana (religion)]]. --[[LMS]]


----


Perhaps I am being dense here. In what way are parenthesis notable different from a slash? Except that they are not going to be interpreted by wiki so will not appear in the hyperlinks in the footer? [[Phil Lord]]


----


You're not being dense, but perhaps you're just asking me to think through what you could easily think through yourself.  :-)  They are not interpreted as hyperlinks in the footer, and moreover, when you are on the subpage, you do not have the psychological experience of looking at a &quot;part&quot; or &quot;subtopic&quot; of an article about the main topic.  The parentheses are well-understood to be a way of identifying the ''sense'' of the words not in parentheses. --[[LMS]]


----


Thats a little bit subtle for me I am afraid. I don't think that there is a standard way in English of disambiguating synonyms. And personally it would appear to me that loosing the footer hyperlinks is a disadvantage. It would seem to me that having followed a link to &quot;Nirvana (rock band)&quot;, you might indeed be interested to know what a &quot;rock band&quot; actually are. And of course suggests a standardised way of disambiguating. Why not Nirvana (music), or Nirvana (20th century) or so on? Having a page actually there, which is linked to can help decide the best one to use.  [[Phil Lord]]


----


You're doing a fine job of playing devil's advocate; why don't you write an essay of your own, and I'll respond? --[[LMS]]


----


I'm not trying to play devil's advocate honestly...If you want to remove this stuff to a /Talk to leave your esssy clear thats fine by me. What I am trying to do is think of a good way of disambiguating terms using the limited technology that wiki provides. You may be right about subpages of course, but its good to think through the possibilities. 


----


No, this is a fine place to talk.  Anyway, you're making an argument, and I am interested in having it spelled out more clearly, that's all: you seem to be suggesting that there is no useful distinction between subpages and titles with disambiguating parentheses.  That just strikes me as a nonstarter, as obviously wrong.  But I could be wrong about that... --[[LMS]]


-----


A topic like [[Pearl Harbor]] can be a main topic, but when it is a subtopic under [[World War II]] then the page is only about Pearl Harbor in the context of World War II.  I think that is desirable.  There should also be a [[Pearl Harbor]] main topic page, which describes where Pearl Harbor is, what it is used for, its historical significance, etc.





Likewise [[World War II/Douglas MacArthur]] would be a different subject then [[Douglas MacArthur]].  The first would be about World War Two, and specifically MacArthur's role in the war, the second about MacArthur, his whole life.





Other good examples are the [[Pelvis]] and [[Penis]] pages, which in their current form should be subpages under [[Human anatomy]], but aren't.





So a subtopic is desirable only in those cases where it can be meaningful discussed within the context of the main topic. - [[TimShell|TS]]


----


Well, I think we disagree about the application of the principles that it seems we agree on.  I don't think any of the pages you list above are very good examples where subpages are advisable, though I guess they aren't bad examples, either.  E.g., [[The Invasion of Pearl Harbor]] is (I guess--I'm no historian) usually considered in the ''overall'' context of World War II, but it is ''also'' considered in the context of U.S. history, of world history--why not [[World History/World War II]]?  Why not [[Wars/World War II]]?  Why not [[World Wars/II]]?  Why not [[Pacific Theater/Pearl Harbor]]?  Do you get my point?





I don't know whether [[pelvis]] and [[penis]] are too &quot;humano-centric&quot; :-), but if so, I would rather they not be subpages under [[human anatomy]].  They should be under [[human pelvis]] and [[human penis]] or perhaps [[pelvis (human)]] and [[penis (human)]].  After all, Tim, why shouldn't we have one central page, [[Penis]], and several subpages: [[Penis/Human]], [[Penis/Giraffe]], [[Penis/Rat]], etc. --[[LMS]]





----


Maybe another explanation for why I used subpages for the [[poker]] stuff might be useful: I don't like using subpages to impose category schemes or to force associations between things that might be independent.  Using the subpage technique for disambiguation definitely has the potential dowside of limiting the scope of the page to the context of its parent.  Sometimes, though, that limitation is actually quite useful, and it doesn't interfere with making top-level pages on related subjects as well.  It's not that I think things like &quot;Texas hold'em&quot; only make sense as a subtopic of poker (in fact, I made that a top-level page as well), but because there were many other ''terms of art'' like &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;fold&quot;, &quot;position&quot;, &quot;agression&quot;, etc., that have specific meanings in the ''context'' of poker that bear little or no relation to their general meaning.  Even mentioning these specific meanings at a top-level page seems like an exercise of lexicography by shovel, just confusing more than enlightening.  Making them subpages not only disambiguates in the same way that &quot;Raise (poker)&quot; would, but it makes it convenient to make cross-links in other pages within the same context of poker.  It is not that I'm imposing any category structure, it's that I'm recognizing a &quot;field of study&quot; or &quot;context&quot; under which there are lots of ordinary words with unusual meanings.  That's why, for example, the top-level &quot;Texas hold'em&quot; page (which I think should exist as its own topic) redirects into &quot;Poker/Texas holdem&quot;, so the latter page can put brackets around things like &quot;/Raise&quot; and know that they will link to the right place.  Ease of content creation and editing is an important reason that good content gets created here, and I wanted to preserve that.  I can see other uses for this technique; for example &quot;Law&quot; might be a context that could benefit from this easy crosslinking.  &quot;Mathematics&quot; is another.  &quot;Derivative&quot;, for example, means something much different to a mathematician than it does to a Wall street investor.  Top-level pages can certainly be created to link into the subpages where the topic is considered important enough in its own right, or when that makes it easier to link to the page from articles outside the context.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

I'm kinda new to the wiki world, but I was wondering if you/we/somone could develop a way to link backwards, instead of forward... ie, an article on [[Pearl Harbor]] could have special syntax in the article marking off a section that belongs to [[World War II/Pearl Harbor]] which would automatically place a link in the footnotes of [[World War II]], iff the article doesn't already link to it.  Make sense? --[[David G. Morton|DGM]]

[http://zwiki.org/ ZWiki] arranges pages hierarchially and has a backlink feature. By clicking on the title of a page you can see a list of pages with links to that page. --[[Antti Kaihola]]

I think this is a very useful feature (I recently changed all the links to [[Augustine]] to [[Augustine of Hippo]] in order to accommodate the fact that the relevant data was moved. A back link feature would be very helpful, but I don't think it would solve the primary problem which is placing things on sub pages makes it seem like everything on that sub page really ought to be a subtopic of the main page.  [[MRC]]

----

The biggest problem I've seen with subpages is that they can't have their own /Talk pages.  Wiki only seems to allow one level of subdirectory.  This is a bummer, as TopicX/SubtopicA and TopicX/SubtopicB might involve two totally different threads of discussion.  Dumping it all onto TopicX/Talk is yucky.  I'm relatively new to this, so if there's a way to do what I just described, please erase my silly comment.  [[MDG]]

The behavior you describe is intentional, and in fact is counted on by a number of pages (my [[Poker]] pages, for example).  There's a convention here that if it becomes necessary to have separate /Talk pages for subtopics (and if this happens, reconsider whether subpages are appropriate in the first place), Use &quot;TopicX/SubtopicA Talk&quot; and &quot;TopicX/SubtopicB Talk&quot;, and make the appropriate links on those pages.  --LDC


----

[[Wikipedia:Folksonomy|Folksonomy]], tagging as in [[Wikipedia:flickr|flickr]] - is that a way forward (perhaps it is already implemented somehow in Wikipedia... I am new to this)

----

I once pondered the advantages of hierarchical categorization versus topically or relationally tagged categorization, and came to the conclusion that it might be a good idea to use both.  I'm not sure Wikimedia projects are set up this way, but I have seen other systems that are.  If tags were to be used here, though, we should standardize them; all the folksonomic endeavors I've seen allow you to make up your own tags, which is not suitable for a factual reference.  Maybe something like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification Library of Congress Classification] would be a good start for tagging.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thursday, June 14, 10:18 AM -- [[Jimbo Wales]] wrote recently on [[Wikipedia-L]]:
:&quot;Accidental linking&quot; is important.  Having page names like &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;Humanities/Philosophy/Existentialism/Sartre&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; might have some appeal, but they would cut down on the ease of use for new authors, which is very important.
This was written in response to Krzysztof P. Jasiutowicz, who had asked, &quot;Are we making the future 100,000 pages totally flat?&quot; i.e., are we not going to impose some sort of hierarchical structure onto the body of Wikipedia articles?

I think this exchange is very interesting.  First, I think Jimbo has a good point about why multiple layers of subpages is a bad idea; you won't know how to link to something without either exploring the structure or doing a search, both of which are time-consuming (not to mention off-putting to new authors--indeed, very important).  So it's better if we can reasonably expect [[Sartre]] or [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to be an article (with one redirecting to the other); we just wikify whatever form of name we think is appropriate (have a look at [[naming conventions]] if you're interested), and go on.  This is called &quot;accidental linking.&quot;

Perhaps more interesting is to ask ''why'' multiple layers of subpages makes accidental linking difficult.  It's obvious enough, but also enlightening to contemplate: multiple layers of subpages requires that people learn our categorization scheme in order to know exactly what a page's address is.  But, for better or worse, there isn't any one ''obvious'' category scheme in existence, much less one ''correct'' category scheme.  Why not?  Good question; a subject for another column.

It's also worth asking what exactly the difference is between a &quot;hard-wired&quot; category scheme, on the one hand, and what we have now, on the other.  Wikipedia at present does, after all, have something ''like'' a category scheme, in that we have links in our articles from topics to what ''might be considered'' subtopics of those topics.  Doesn't that constitute its own sort of structure?  Yes, or so it seems, but there are two differences:
# A hard-wired scheme is inherently more difficult to change (if it's not, it's not ''hard-wired'').  This is contrary to the present Wikipedia (and Nupedia) system, because anyone can go in and change around categories, add them, delete them, create entire new &quot;high-level&quot; pages, create &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; pages, etc.
# A hard-wired scheme--at least in its traditional format, as can be seen on Yahoo! and dmoz.org--has a definite topic-subtopic ''hierarchy''; the main topic bears a somewhat similar relation to the subtopic that a parent does to a child.  Wikipedia pages, on the other hand, except where subpages have been created, have merely ''links to'' other pages, and once you get a few links past the HomePage, there is no implied or logically inferrable hierarchy.  [[Psychology]] and [[philosophy]] will both link to [[philosophy of psychology]] (which will in turn link back), and from this logical structure alone it will be impossible to determine which page is supposed to be the &quot;parent&quot; page and which page is the &quot;child&quot; page.

These are ''good'' things, for a variety of reasons.  I would explain in more detail, but I am out of time.  Perhaps the next column will address the question: ''why is it preferable'' to have a category structure such that, simply by viewing the linking relations between pages, it is impossible to determine which page is &quot;parent&quot; and which is &quot;child&quot;?  I fully believe it ''is'' preferable.  Why?

By the way, this is one more reason to eschew subpages on Wikipedia (cf. [[/Why I am suspicious of subpages |my last column]])--as I might also explain.

Friday, June 15, 3:40 PM -- Soon, we will be able to disambiguate topics by using parentheses.  It's worth starting to think about some general principles about ''when to use'' parentheses, and ''what to put'' in the parentheses.

Let me work with some examples, and draw some principles from how I would decide them.  [[:en:Apple]] can mean either the fruit or a kind of computer.  But probably, it would be wisest to let [[:en:apple]] mean the fruit and include a link on the [[:en:apple]] page to [[:en:Apple Computer]].

Here's a similar example, using the recently-edited article [[:en:icon]].  Originally, some programmer type, in all seriousness (and doubtless without meaning any harm to anybody), innocently went about writing the article as though there were no such things as religious icons and that &quot;icon&quot; unambiguously meant a programming language.  In actuality, [[:en:icon]] in its religious sense is probably the very most important sense, and nobody but programmers gives a rat's patoot about Icon-the-programming-language (with all due respect to the programmers!).  So we might just let the [[:en:icon]] page discuss the religious sense--rather than putting it on [[:en:icon (religion)]]--and on the [[:en:icon]] page include links to [[:en:Icon (programming language)]] and [[:en:icon (computers)]] or [[:en:icon (computer jargon)]] (or something like that).

I believe that consideration of these cases supports the following principle:
: When there is ''one central, best-known, most common'' meaning to the term &quot;xyz&quot; (&quot;xyz&quot; here is just a variable), and in that sense &quot;xyz&quot; names a topic about which we'll want an encyclopedia article, then we should put discussion of that topic on [[:en:xyz]] with no parentheses, and from [[:en:xyz]] we should include links to ''other'' articles under the heading &quot;xyz&quot; but qualified with parentheses, such as [[:en:xyz (pdq)]] and [[:en:xyz (abc)]].

Here's another issue that needs adjudication: given that we've decided we're going to use parentheses to disambiguate topics, what should we put in the parentheses?  Take the [[:en:icon]] example again.  Suppose we've decided (for whatever reason) to make [[:en:icon]] just a pointer page, and we needed parenthetical qualifications for our ''three'' senses of &quot;icon.&quot;  How do we decide what to put in parentheses?

I might choose [[:en:icon (religion)]], [[:en:icon (programming language)]], and [[:en:icon (computer jargon)]].  Why?

In the first sense, I wouldn't choose [[:en:icon (religious symbolism)]], because &quot;religion&quot; is probably going to be useful in disambiguating many other titles.  Another possibility is [[:en:icon (art)]], I suppose.  Again, though, my favorite for the religious sense is just [[:en:icon]], because the religious sense is after all the most basic sense.

I might choose [[:en:Icon (programming language)]] (much like the already-existing [[:en:Icon programming language]]), rather than [[:en:icon (computers)]], because the latter is ''too'' broad: there are at least ''two'' things that &quot;icon&quot; (or &quot;Icon&quot;) means when discussing computers (the language, and the little clickable image).  I also wouldn't use [[:en:icon (language)]], because &quot;language&quot; here is insufficiently precise: when presented with the word &quot;language,&quot; what most people immediately think of is an ordinary, natural language like English or French.

Finally, I might choose [[:en:icon (computer jargon)]], because that's something the nonspecialist could understand.  I imagine there is some piece of computer science jargon to describe the general sort of thing an icon is, and you could title the article [[:en:icon (that-piece-of-jargon)]], but that wouldn't be clear to the person who, after all, needs to know what &quot;icon&quot; means.  Besides, &quot;computer jargon&quot; is probably going to end up being a very useful way to qualify various titles; think &quot;disk,&quot; &quot;processor,&quot; &quot;processing speed,&quot; &quot;mouse,&quot; &quot;keyboard,&quot; etc., etc.

So there are a few principles/remarks that seem reasonable to me:
* In general, put stuff in parentheses that is both easy to guess (to expedite &quot;accidental linking&quot;) and that successfully disambiguates titles.
* Use qualifying words that are used to qualify other article titles as well (to expedite &quot;accidental linking&quot;).
* If at all possible, keep the qualifying words simple and clear, so that nonspecialists can understand them.
* So, the qualifying phrases are probably going to name ''rather general'' categories that an article's subject falls under, but not ''so'' general as not to be able to distinguish it from the other subjects named by the title.

Well, that's my ''first'' stab at these issues.  I'm sure others will have lots to say too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Monday, June 25, 11:17 AM -- It must by now be a commonplace observation that the nature of peer review can change, in some cases has changed, and no doubt will change even further as a result of modes of interaction that only the Internet has made possible. Today I want to discuss a few questions about peer review that Nupedia and Wikipedia raise. While Nupedia is very definitely peer-reviewed, but in a rather unconventional way, Wikipedia is, one might say, ''reviewed,'' to some extent, but not necessarily peer-reviewed. In this column I would like to answer the following questions:
* How does Nupedia's review process differ from the traditional one, and is it any better for those differences?
* Is there any sense in which we might say that Wikipedia is reviewed, or even peer-reviewed?
* Compared to ''traditional'' standards of peer review, how does Wikipedia stack up?
* Is there any reason to think that the standards of Wikipedia &quot;review&quot; will become any more rigorous, and if so, would that be a good thing?

First, what ''is'' [[peer review]]? Roughly, we might say a work is peer-reviewed if it has been commented on critically, by an intellectual or professional peer of the author, as a condition of its acceptance for publication. The whole purpose of peer review is quality-assurance: we want to ensure that what is published is high enough quality not to constitute a waste of readers' time. It's worth reflecting on the fact, and many an academic of course ''has'' reflected on the fact, that peer review often does not achieve this purpose; often, what undergoes peer review and is accepted for publication ''is,'' in fact, a waste of nearly everyone's time.

''How does Nupedia's review process differ from the traditional one, and is it any better for those differences?''

There are two ways in which Nupedia's review process differs considerably from the traditional one. While it is sometimes possible in peer-reviewed publications for an author to respond to and work with a reviewer, it is rarely to the extent that is permitted, and some cases even required, by Nupedia's Lead Review step. In Lead Review, the reviewer and author engage in a ''discussion'' about the article, via a web forum interface, that leads to the improvement of the article. Then, in the Open Review step, a public peer review of the article occurs; this can only be compared to the give-and-take of the Q&amp;amp;A portion of a conference presentation, which often occurs before an article is published, but is not required.

All this means that Nupedia articles receive, on average, much ''closer'' attention than they would receive under the traditional review process, and the process is aimed more at consensus and improvement than at deciding to accept an article. Arguably, these are improvements over the traditional process.

''Is there any sense in which we might say that Wikipedia is reviewed, or even peer-reviewed?''

In one obvious sense, Wikipedia is reviewed: as a matter of fact, many eyeballs look at different articles, and if some change or addition seems to someone to be necessary, the person makes it. More rarely, a less [[Be bold in updating pages|bold]] Wikipedian will post a criticism on the article's &quot;Talk&quot; page, rather than changing the article itself, leaving it to some other person to make the required changes.

Now, examination of these facts, along with definitions of &quot;review&quot; and &quot;peer review,&quot; leads one to conclude that Wikipedia's give-and-take process does not constitute review, let alone peer review. Review requires an approval of a reviewer before an article can be ''accepted for publication.'' On Wikipedia, anybody can publish anything at any time. Of course, others can immediately delete nonsense, as happens sometimes; but explicit acceptance is not required. Even if one allows stretching the meaning of &quot;review,&quot; by saying that the examination and editing of an article by other Wikipedians constitutes a sort of review, this sort of review isn't ''peer'' review except in those rare cases where two or more people are at work on articles about subjects about which they are both bona fide experts.

''Compared to traditional standards of peer review, how does Wikipedia stack up?''

In the short term, very poorly. Wikipedia's process allows many bad articles to get published. But see below.

''Is there any reason to think that the standards of Wikipedia &quot;review&quot; will become any more rigorous, and if so, would that be a good thing?''

Yes, and yes, and here, things get interesting. Wikipedia articles are getting constantly better as people go back again and again to old articles to add to them, reword misleading statements, correct factual errors, etc. This means that the ''quality'' of Wikipedia articles is ever-improving. An improvement in quality will be noticeable to experts. A shoddy article about topic T in 2001 will be a great article about topic T in 2002. And whereas an expert on T would be so disgusted by the article that he wouldn't think of participating in Wikipedia, in 2002 he might be so impressed by the article, and therefore also by Wikipedia's collaborative article-creation process, that he becomes a Wikipedian on the spot.

So here is my thesis and prediction: as Wikipedia articles improve, it will attract more and more experts. Wikipedia participation in the beginning was limited to many hobbyists, students, and generalists, and a few experts; but in a few years, this project will have attracted the attention of very many more experts.

I've already said [[why Wikipedia is so great|elsewhere]] that Wikipedia has gained and will gain traffic by creating content, and as a result will create even more content even faster. In a similar fashion, Wikipedia will by the nature of the project (and the stewardship of those who care most about it) increase constantly in quality, and as a result become the sort of resource that can attract the sort of people who can make this into a work of the very ''best'' quality.

So, in ''both'' quantity and quality, Wikipedia's encyclopedic wealth will beget even greater wealth.

This bootstrapping process might very well become a very adequate ''substitute'' for and even an ''improvement'' on peer review processes, both traditional and Nupedian. Wikipedia articles, because they are ever-improving and because the barriers to contributing are minimal, do not need to be reviewed. Eventually, those faults in a newly-created Wikipedia article that would cause a reviewer to reject it will be smoothed over by new contributors. Eventually, Wikipedia's articles will, I think, ''far exceed'' the level of quality that would lead a reviewer to accept them. This is possible because Wikipedia is, again, ever-improving and because the barriers to contribution are minimal. So, one might conclude that, paradoxically, ''within the context of the Wikipedia project'' at least, ''the lack of'' a peer review process (properly so-called) will lead to ''superior'' quality in the long run. That's just a prediction, but I think it's worth exploring, and it is already supported by some evidence.

It's kind of annoying (though I admit perfectly permissible) that some people see fit to completely wipe out a reasonably well written page for no other reason it seems than they want to be the one to write it. For example, in a few places I noticed that previous revisions that seemed perfectly acceptable were wiped out in favor of someone else's preference to dwell on pronunciation of a name or something equally frivolous. This kind of thing goes against the whole &quot;adding knowledge&quot; philosophy, and could possibly lead to &quot;vendetta&quot; edits. There is little doubt in my mind that these edits were made by the same &quot;experts&quot; referred to above. While I respect and enjoy the wiki process, it sometimes maybe allows people to dwell too heavily on one aspect of their study without the benefit of heavy-handed editorialship. - AD
----
Dear Mr. Alan Dershowitz (?!), one definitely has to have a thick skin here, there's no question of that. Disputes about how to edit a page can be and often are resolved on the &lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt; page associated with the article. I'm not quite sure what you're referring to re wiping out an entire page just to replace it with a different article, though. Maybe you could point me to such an instance--I'd be personally curious. Obviously, we want to ''add'' knowledge here, developing work that others have done, rather than replacing it outright. The only time when the latter is acceptable, to my mind, is when the replaced article is so totally incompetent that it simply had no useful content, and it was better simply to begin again. --[[LMS]]
----
This is something I wrote on [[Piotr Wozniak]]'s page that I thought might be applicable here as well:

Seeing this wonderfully learned and intelligent guy about has inspired me to write the bio for another Wozniak: [[Steve Wozniak]], who may or may not have been learned but was definitely also quite intelligent. The link is currently dead because I haven't actually written the article. That will happen in good time if I remember too.

Also, I wholeheartedly agree with you about the rampant editing. Open source is good, but dicks abound in this world. If Wikipedia ever does become very, very popular, they will surely set about deleting things. I'd hate to see a 5000 word article be replaced by &quot;Dan loves Sarah&quot; or &quot;Free Kevin Mitchell&quot;. I suggest first: [putting an edit freeze on and then] automatically adding a /Talk section to all articles, to lodge constructive or destructive criticism. These talk pages should definitly show up on recent changes, but probably not on searches for the subject about which they are talking, as their existence would be implied. Secondly: Maybe [[Larry Sanger]] should select some responsible, educated, impartial, experienced, etc., etc. contributors to be moderators, who could decide disagreements that aren't so easily resolved. I'm sure many would be willing volunteers. I'd be happy to if I were only educated, responsible, impartial, or experienced.

While I might not have the character to be a moderator, I could write a conflict submission page in html that would be more practical than making one big Conflict Moderation Wiki page.


* &lt;b&gt;A little addition after having given it some thought:&lt;/b&gt;

I think that moderators can still work with the Wikipedia theme without becoming just another Nupedia. First of all, considering that an article can be published so easily, and that the review process will be so less stringent, Wikipedia ought to still grow much faster and be more in the way of the &quot;Open Source&quot; spirit. ( In that less qualified people can review, which I don't consider a necessarily bad thing considering I don't even have a high school diploma. ) You don't really need to deal with conflicts between part-time, volunteer moderators, because it simply doesn't matter that much. This is, after all, not Nupedia. The main problem here is as I see it is not the reliability of the articles, as that's Nupedia's business, but the fear of having hours of work simply deleted. It's not a problem for me because [[Japan/History]] probably isn't all that popular a subject amongst Wikipedia's English speaking audience, and none of sound mind and body can dispute my knowledge and understanding of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Others, though, have lost a lot of valuable time.

There are other issues, such as people writing an article and then never bothering to answer criticism, or moderators being deluged by complaints, but what it all comes down to is that it can't do any harm. If moderators get sick of it, they can just quit, and some people will have to wait. So what?

This would all call for some significant changes to UseModWiki, implementation of a mailing list, a new form page, etc., but if you want to make changes, all you need do is post a list of parameters, in which case I could personally contribute by taking it to friends. Or, if you don't mind being nailed again, you could get an open source call-to-arms posted, if not on Slashdot, one of the smaller yet comparable computer nerd forums.


Also, I think you should know that your Wikipedia is keeping me up way to late. ( 2:39 a.m., as of the moment ). I don't know if you should be proud for getting me addicted to a new realm of knowlege, or feel ashamed for shattering my beauty sleep. I can just picture the black marks under my eyes right now.

--[[Seckstu]]

----
Ooh, ooh, I know. People could request to change a page, and if the author doesn't respond in a given time, the requestor than has power to change it. Maybe even earn the title &quot;author&quot; himself. This would make UseModWiki much more complicated, but enough open source programmers can handle that. It would probably be a big load on the server, but maybe distributing the server load? I could might be able to talk [[David Reed]] at Simon's Rock into some hosting, and others might do the same. Damn, that's even more complicated. But still, other people can figure such things out if they want to, because I need to go to bed now. As I see it though, the only real impediment to Wikigrowth is that hours of oh-so valuable time, of writing and guarding articles, can be so easily lost. Easier solutions than mine are likely better, but if that one problem is fixed, well, I tingle at the idea of this place's potential. ( Not that I don't already. )

--[[Seckstu]] again. Sorry. My brain storms a lot in the wee hours of the night.
----
The short answer to your concerns, [[Steckstu]] (which is all I can afford right now), is that there just isn't any serious problem about vandalism on Wikipedia yet, and you would do well to give some thought as to why not. With greater size, this will probably change, though, and that ''could'' really be a huge problem--we'll have to change the [[Recent Changes]] page functionality accordingly. I'm about to write a column about this. --[[LMS]]

== Public Health Warning Required ==

To echo my comments on the main site. 

A public health warning is required that warns people not to use Wikipedia as an authoritative reference - the current disclaimers are inadequate and not sufficiently prominent. I believe there should be a prominant disclaimer placed in large bold friendly &quot;Don't Panic&quot; letters on the front page. Yes, I know there is a disclaimer on each page and that the disclaimer page uses large bold letters - but these are not sufficiently prominent and most members of the public will not click through.

I am also concerned that the Wikipedia content is being represented by such sites as ANSWERS.COM where the problem is in fact greater than on the main site because the content is presented with some authority and the disclaimer is watered down to read:

&lt;i&gt;This entry is from Wikipedia, the leading user-contributed encyclopedia. It may not have been reviewed by professional editors.&lt;/i&gt;

I note with increasing concern that Google appear to be giving priority to Wikipedia pages and so the public will be misled. I believe something needs to be done urgently. It needs to be done by the architects and developers of Wikipedia since a prominent disclaimer is required at the head of every page throughout the 'pedia and it needs to propagate out to the distributions. I even find myself reading a Wikipedia article on Answers.com and it IS NOT immediately clear that it is a Wikipedia article. We really need to do something about it. 

In particular, the public need to be aware that the information in Wikipedia may not only contain errors and bias but that the collected articles can be hijacked subtly by special interests to provide a distorted view of the facts, that - in fact - Wikipedia is NOT A PROCESS OF PEER REVIEW since peer review suggests a collection of authors with equal authority in a given subject area. Wikipedia is a PROCESS OF MOB REVIEW - let's be clear about that!

A website that is attributed to an individual carries with it the authority only of that individual - and is relatively easy to assess. Though it remains a problem too, the problem is lesser because people are innately aware of the issue of dealing with individuals - individuals have to earn respect and authority. 

The situation is different at Wikipedia where authority comes by convention associated simply by calling the site an encyclopedia. Good and valid contributions provide authority by association to less worthy contributions and can be quickly over written by the misguided and the malicious. Authority becomes detacted from that of a single individual and the public misinterpret the standing of the content.

It is made worse when other &quot;authorities&quot; (like Google and Answers.com) claim, without the appropriate caveats, that Wikipedia &quot;is a good idea&quot; because it can be edited by anyone. Wikipedia is an interesting exercise, it's like a political game, it &lt;b&gt;IS NOT A PEER REVIEWED ENCYCLOPEDIA IN ANY SENSE&lt;/b&gt;.  It misdirects the public and could eventually undermine the basis of all public consensus since the public may come eventually to feel betrayed by intellectual authority.

The bottomline is that Wikipedia holds significant social danger, the public is being misled regarding its authority and can be manipulated by the unscrupulous. If you are complacent now, the problem will arise in the future, long after we here are gone, and be noticed too late. We need to encourage and support the individual responsiblility to assess authority - but without a clear public health warning the general public will take the content as read.

Thursday, June 28, 6:10 PM -- So Wikipedia has almost 10,000 pages.  This represents a heck of a lot of work and a heck of a lot of content, and we can all be proud, but...I think there's a bit of a problem.  I have a puzzle for you: how many of these pages are ''articles''?

''We'' all know &quot;10,000 pages&quot; does not mean &quot;10,000 encyclopedia articles.&quot;  There are a lot of redirection pages, Talk pages, member pages and subpages, commentary pages, Wikipedia project pages, and other non-articles.  But the new reader doesn't know this, and if some news media source comes along (as they inevitably will--it's only a matter of time now), I think we might be blasted for misrepresenting the extent of our achievement.  Not only would that be shameful, it lose us the participation of potential new contributors who ''care'' about how accurately we represent our achievement, though they don't care if we say we have 10,000 or, instead, a mere 6,000 articles.  :-)

I wouldn't envy anyone the task of counting the ''actual'' number of articles.  But we could estimate the number.

Anyone care to give it a shot, and report the results?

For purposes of this exercise, I don't think we need to draw a distinction between one-sentence articles to the effect that so-and-so was a famous novelist, and treatise-length pages.  Both of those can, for our purposes, be called articles, or perhaps &quot;entries.&quot;  What ''can't'' be called articles are:
* redirection pages
* Talk pages
* member pages and subpages thereof
* pages describing the Wikipedia project (e.g., the FAQ, news, announcements, etc.)
* pages that consist ''only'' of links to other articles, with virtually no content of their own
* any other categories?

What I'd like to do with your estimate is to make the assumption that the ''ratio'' of present pages to present articles will remain roughly the same for the next 5,000 or so ''pages.''  (Or perhaps you can tell me how long the ratio can probably be relied upon.)

Then, we can (honestly) boast &quot;over 5,000 articles&quot; (notice, articles, not pages) or &quot;over 5,000 entries&quot; on the front page.  This will make our work seem more substantial, more real, and that's important if we're going to make this a reasonably serious project.

I'll bet the present number is right around 5,000, but I really don't know!

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

A quick check as of a few minutes ago showed
9690 pages in total, of which 1348 redirect to another page, and 335 are &lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt; subpages, leaving 8007 actual pages. Excluding the redirects, 4% of all pages are talk pages.
&lt;br&gt;
Counting only &quot;comma pages&quot;, we have
6789 pages of which 286 are &lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt; subpages, leaving 6583 non-Talk pages which contain at least one comma. &lt;br&gt;
So, it seems that just about 4% of all entries excluding redirects, or 4% of all &quot;comma pages&quot; are &lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt; subpages, if that's any help in the estimates.


I'll do a rerun tomorrow, which I hope will have some filtering of members' pages and their subpages from the totals.. -- [[Malcolm Farmer]]

How did you do these calculations?  I'm not questioning your methodology; I'm just curious.  --KQ

Yes, I'm curious too! --LMS

Well, I did a search for the redirect command; that gives a count of redirects (and probably a few pages discussing the redirect, but they're pages we want to exclude from the count anyway)
Counting the /talk pages is easy enough: first my Perl script requests a search, either for a blank (all pages) or a comma. The number of pages is listed at the top of the returned page, and the /talk pages are counted by the script just going down the page line by line counting the matches for &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;  I'm no great programmer, so I really appreciate how easy Perl makes it to knock up a small script for analysing stuff. - Malcolm Farmer
----
See [[Malcolm Farmer/How many Wikipedia pages are there]] for Malcolm's work!

I'll say we have &quot;over 6,000 articles&quot; on the main page.  Any objections? --[[LMS]]
----
A potential method of checking to see which articles are probably of high-quality, and thus how many &quot;real&quot; articles vs. how many &quot;stub&quot; entires, would be to check the number of revisions (major and minor, if possible) done to any article.  I'd place a bet that given a little analysis, you could determine the average number of revisions needed before an article reached a certain degree of quality (and perhaps length, too.)

Of course, this would require a more intensive stats program -- probably best if it ran with access to the Wikipedia files themselves. --[[Colin dellow]]

----

The problem with counting revisions is that there seems to be little correlation between the number of revisions and the quality of the article. 
* About 1500 articles have been renamed and replaced with a redirect, the renamed article effectively being new-born.
* Some articles get posted, and very few changes are made to them: whether this is because they are so good or because no-one else feels competent to revise them is a matter of judgement. 
* Some articles get repeated minor changes in spelling and/or layout: some get revised several times a day, like [[Biographical Listing]]. 
* And there's that quirk whereby when an article is created, articles with pre-existing links pointing to it don't show that it now exists: so people just add a space character to the page so that the new link shows up...
I think automated quality assessment via revision history is a non-starter. It needs people in the loop.
-- [[Malcolm Farmer]]
----
I bet we have 15,000 articles now, Larry.  --KQ
----
Maybe?  Malcolm? --LMS
----
I have just learned that people intend to add individual pages for people who died in the Sep. 11 attack. I have no objection; but I was wondering should we count them as encyclopedia articles? They aren't encyclopedia articles in the traditional sense at least, since except for having been victims many (if not most) of them would never have got pages. Since fatalities are expected to number in the thousands, we could potentially have a significant inflation of the article count. And if we do decide to exclude them from the page count, might it be a good idea to include some set phrase (e.g. &quot;victim of [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]&quot;) so that we can easily exclude them from the page count? -- [[Simon J Kissane]]

I think this is a non-issue. I think the creation of new non-attack-related articles will continue at the same rate as before. New obituary pages will appear over a long period, surely, not a few thousand at once. I don't think there's any chance of obituary pages &quot;taking over&quot;. And even if they would amount to a few percent of the total number of pages for a while, so what? [[Wikipedia commentary/Wiki is not paper|Wiki is not paper]], after all. --[[Pinkunicorn]]

Monday, July 2, 2001, 11:05 AM -- Part of what makes [[Wikipedia]] work is that we do not require perfection, and I strongly believe we should continue adding as much imperfect stuff to Wikipedia as we possibly can. There is some value, however, in describing what sort of thing we're aiming at, namely, The Perfect Article. ''That's'' not my subject today, however. My subject is something that is something more clearly within our immediate grasp: The Perfect ''Stub'' Article.

Most of us can agree that stub articles are good things. They help to fill out the ''breadth'' of Wikipedia, giving us actual content to work with in our attempts to organize and present all of human knowledge, and--important from a practical point of view--giving the search engines more to link to. This means more traffic and therefore more contributors--a virtuous cycle.

(But, just by the way, I think that we need a lot of in-depth articles as well, if for no other reason than to attract and retain the well-educated people who are more interested in the in-depth articles. Having nothing but stub articles would make the project look frivolous. Besides, we are going to want nearly all our articles to be in-depth articles in the end.)

Let's say that you want to start adding in a bunch of stub articles on various subjects. Great! Wonderful idea! So what guidelines would you follow in order to create the ''perfect'' stub article?
# Give a clear, precise [[w:definition]] (or description--see below) of your topic. Make the first sentence a ''full sentence,'' which repeats the topic title in either italics or bold. (Probably bold, I concede, because that just looks better in most browsers.) See [[w:fallacies of definition]] if you're not sure what constitutes a good definition. But make sure that your topic (and therefore your definition) is one on which we are going to want an actual encyclopedia article. In other words, bear in mind that [[w:Wikipedia is not a dictionary]]. There are only two (closely-related) sorts of article, that I can think of, that will consist of ''just'' a definition. '''First, jargon.''' In some cases it will be fine and quite useful to include just a definition of some jargon, where the ''substantive issues'' surrounding that piece of jargon are discussed ''elsewhere.'' For example, I might define ''a priori'' in the [[w:a priori]] article, and then put pointers to [[w:a priori truth]] and [[w:a priori knowledge]] articles, where the real content about the topic will exist. '''Second, pointer pages.''' The other sort of acceptable &quot;definition-only&quot; article would be a pointer page, consisting of a list of several divergent senses of a word, each defined on the page, and each definition followed by a pointer to an article where the topic, in ''that'' sense, is discussed in more depth. On such a pointer page, by the way, I see little reason to list senses of the word or phrase if those senses are not the subjects of encyclopedia articles.
# For biographies and articles about non-concepts (e.g., about countries and cities), definitions are impossible; so begin with a clear, helpful, informative ''description'' of the thing, e.g., what he person is famous for, where a place is and what known for, the basic details of an event and when it happened, etc.
# Do not simply repeat the title in the article, except ''as part'' of a full sentence. The article already has a title, at the top of the page.
# Give ''more'' than just a definition--at least a little more. Write at least a sentence, giving a few more details about why the person is important, what role a concept plays in a field of study, some important details about a historical event (or some of its important consequences), etc. Now, why do I keep harping on this? I have a hypothesis, which I think is a very reasonable hypothesis. I think that it is important to the ''psychology'' of Wikipedia that we all understand ourselves as not writing articles that simply ''identify'' people, events, and concepts, in a very basic way, but that actually give details, &quot;empirical facts,&quot; content. That tiny extra bit of content is very important, psychologically speaking, because every time it is written, or read by another contributor, it makes it clear that the project ''is indeed'' eventually going to be about going deep into all these subjects. See [[w:Wiktionary|Wiktionary]]
# Follow the standards of proper English. Write in full, clear sentences.
# Be accurate. Say things that are true, not false.
# [[w:neutral point of view|Be unbiased]].
# Make sure any linkable words have been linked. But be careful about which words you link to; see [[w:naming conventions]] and [[w:topic creation]].
# Optional: leave something undone, or even ask a question (often, italicized) in the article for others to answer.

For most of us, these aren't hard rules to follow; it just requires a bit of extra time and concentration. And it is possible to follow these guidelines without writing a treatise. Generally, for the shortest of Perfect Stubs, two sentences will do fine--as long as they're two ''good'' sentences.

On the other hand, you can always ignore these guidelines entirely, and someone will probably fix the article for you! That's the beauty of a wiki.

But if we all make an effort to follow these rules, I think it will raise the overall level of quality on the project.

''Some version of the above should probably be added to [[w:Wikipedia policy]]...''

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]


You can use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the stub articles.This is how it looks like &lt;br&gt;

''This essay applies to subpages in wikipedia, not other wikis where they may be more applicable (wikibooks)''

Monday, July 2, 1:03 PM -- Another column today--I was inspired.  In two previous columns ([[Why I am suspicious of subpages|/Why I am suspicious of subpages]] and [[Accidental linking and hard-wired category schemes|/Accidental linking and hard-wired category schemes]]) I gave a few reasons to &quot;eschew subpages&quot;, and in the former, I referred to the existence of a number of other good reasons to avoid subpages (though not, as I've also said, in ''every'' case).  So what are those other good reasons?  Here is a laundry list; there are probably other reasons.

* '''Arbitrary, at what level subpages are created.'''  It seems entirely arbitrary ''at what level'' subpages will be created.  In most cases, there is no good reason why X should be considered a subpage of Y, when Y could just as easily be made a subpage of Z, and so on.
* '''Only one level of hierarchy--arbitrary and unappealing.'''  Subpages allows us to impose ''some'' conceptual structure or hierarchy on topics--but only ''one level'' of hierarchy.  This is conceptually unappealing.  Shouldn't it be either ''all'' or ''none''?  Better yet, why not let ''links internal to the articles'' specify the conceptual relationships between articles?
* '''The parent page-subpage relationship is variable--again, arbitrary and unappealing.'''  The relationship between parent page and subpage is entirely variable, which is puzzling and, again, conceptually unappealing.  For example, we could make &quot;CountriesA&quot; a subpage of &quot;Countries of the world&quot;; then, the list of pages under &quot;CountriesA&quot; would be the set of the countries of the world whose names in English begin with the letter &quot;A.&quot;  We could also make &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; a subtopic of &quot;World War II,&quot; and the relationship here is that Pearl Harbor is the-location-of-an-important-attack-in World War II.  We could make &quot;David Hume&quot; a subtopic of &quot;Philosopher&quot; because Hume is a philosopher.  Etc.  What does the slash ''mean''?
* '''We don't know when to use subpages--it's arbitrary.'''  It is difficult to guess when other people will have created a subpage hierarchy and when not.  There are no clear, intuitive standards that we are following in making the decision.  This makes it marginally more difficult to guess at page titles, for one thing.
* '''Subpage titles are ugly.'''  Subpage titles are typically ugly--they employ nonstandard punctuation (the slash), for one thing.
* '''One main motivation, disambiguation, will soon disappear.'''  As soon as Jimbo and crew installs the newest [[UseModWiki|UseMod]] version, we will be able to use parentheses in titles.

Only in some very few cases does the convenience of subpages seem to outweigh the above reasons.  Even in those cases I have my doubts, and even in those cases I'm liking subpages less and less.  They seem particularly useful only for a field or hobby or fictional world that has a large amount of &quot;in&quot; jargon that is not used anywhere else, and that constitutes a sort of self-contained system.  But the fact that subpages are used only for these cases and not others might itself seem to be a problem, insofar as we would like (''eventually'') consistent solutions to the disambiguation problem.

''Meta-subpages like '''/''''''Talk''' and'''/''''''Opinions''' seem to be all right, then:''

* '''''Non arbitrary:''' there is always a &quot;Talk&quot;.  In general, we standardize on a fixed, small number of meta-subpages.''
* '''''Non ambiguous:''' &quot;Talk&quot; always means the same thing.  In general, meta-subpages always have a &quot;meta&quot; kind of relationship with the parent.''

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----

Here's a possible software solution, but that probably will require significant work (though some of it will lead to other benefits).  Allow authors to embed non-printing instructions in a page, similar to the #REDIRECT available now.  This can also be used for metadata if we want rather than the subpage idea.  In particular, allow the embedding of a &quot;Context&quot; tag to disambiguate links.  For example, in a page labelled &quot;#CONTEXT Mathematics&quot;, a simple link to &quot;real&quot; would look first for a link &quot;Real (Mathematics)&quot;, and only if it didn't find one, link to &quot;Real&quot; at a top level.  This obviates my use of subpages for disambiguation, while making linking even easier.  I think it is critically important to make correct ad-hoc linking easy for authors and editors.  This would be a minor chore for the first author or editor to establish the context, but thereafter no other editors would need to bother with it--it would just work.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

''Seconded enthusiastically.  I have some familiarity with the code of [[UseModWiki]] and might send Clifford Adams a patch to implement #CONTEXT.''

Is it enough to '''prepend''' non-printing instructions in a page, rather than &quot;embed&quot; as LDC suggests?  Example:
::&lt;nowiki&gt;#CONTEXT Mathematics&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::In Mathematics, a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[real]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; number is defined as...
would be allowed and honored, but
::In Mathematics,
::&lt;nowiki&gt;#CONTEXT Mathematics&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[real]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; number is defined as...
would not be.

How would you like '''multiple''' context?

::&lt;nowiki&gt;#CONTEXT xxx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::&lt;nowiki&gt;#CONTEXT yyy&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::About &lt;nowiki&gt;[[aaa]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;...

would link to &quot;aaa (xxx)&quot; if it does exist, otherwise to &quot;aaa (yyy)&quot; if it does exist, otherwise to &quot;aaa&quot;.

----

'''A problem with #CONTEXT''' as proposed is that it would invalidate existing pages (and require them to be tracked down and regenerated) as context-specific entries are created.  [[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]] suggests:

::&lt;nowiki&gt;#CONTEXT Mathematics&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Real]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; algebraic roots...

:''would look first for a link &quot;Real (Mathematics)&quot;, and only if it didn't find one, link to &quot;Real&quot; at a top level''.

Let's say that, at the moment I save the example above, &quot;Real (Mathematics)&quot; does not exist: the link then will point to &quot;Real&quot;, and [[UseModWiki]] may cache the generated HTML for efficiency.  Now someone creates &quot;Real (Mathematics)&quot;.  At that point my example

*either will start pointing to &quot;Real (Mathematics)&quot; as soon as it is displayed (an automatic redirection that nobody has explicitly asked for, or even is aware of)
*or will keep pointing to &quot;Real&quot; until is edited and saved again and the HTML regenerated (leading to potentially stale content, at least in some minor way)

Are we aware of this limitation?  I personally can live with it, but I'd like to set expectations straight.

----

Interesting idea, Lee.  I'm not sure if I definitely like it, but it sounds like a nice improvement.

Yes, /Talk pages are definitely exceptions. --[[LMS]]

----

Worryingly, Larry, I am coming round to your way of thinking (see [[Quotation/Talk]]) but this is primarily since we only have one level of sub-paging. The #CONTEXT fix would certainly make for an improvement all round IMHO; the caching problem should be negligible, and it wouldn't be terribly difficult to have a bot run every so often to resolve these discrepancies. [[sjc]]

----
I like the idea but do have some questions:
*Will there be a limited number of #CONTEXTs allowed?  If so, won't that eventually be decided as arbitrary?  If not, won't it eventually cause conflict?  What if authors disagree about a context (this is ''very'' possible in the arts)?  Can pages be assigned more than one context?  What if authors disagree about the ranking?
*What if a very specific page (a &quot;context&quot; page) is created when the more general one hasn't been?  Will links ignore the more specific page, or point to it?  Which context (if any) will be taken as standard?
*Would the #CONTEXT command take place of parentheses ''as well as'' subpages, or be used in conjunction with them?  I, for one, would much prefer #CONTEXT Mathematics for &quot;Real&quot; but not #CONTEXT Play for Shakespeare's Henry V and #CONTEXT Kenneth Branagh and #CONTEXT Laurence Olivier for the movies (they ''could'' both have entries of their own, discussing different technical and artistic points, though I'm not the scholar to write them).
*Will every page have a #CONTEXT field?  I think that nearly subject could fit in more than one field.  But I'm not sure what I'd make of a person having apparently distinct pages in separate areas; I think I'd rather see them all ''visibly'' linked and choose which (or all) of them to read.
Again, I do like the idea, but I think the issues above are relevant (and, besides, it's better to have a plan and not need it).  --KQ</text>

Thursday, July 5, 12:41 PM -- Today I'm going to expostulate (a fancy word for &quot;spew&quot;) at you a bit on another one of my pet peeves.  I hope you won't get the idea that I am trying to bury Wikipedia in negativism.  I think Wikipedia is one of the good things in life, like ice cream and puppies; but sometimes, even a good thing can be improved.  Almost everyone should read this and then go right back to doing whatever it was that they were doing before they read it--I only need a few, good people to read, agree, and act.
&lt;nowiki&gt;
There are certain pages, such as [[sport]], [[music]], some of the [[film]]-related pages, and some of the [[computing]]-related pages, that consist of--ugh--lists of internal links.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I don't mind lists.  I love them, myself.  I like making [[to do list]]s, and anyone who has read my e-mails and philosophy papers knows that I love to number items.  It just makes things seem clearer, somehow, even when it doesn't.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Now, I would like to gently point out that a list, is, well, ''not an encyclopedia article.''

&lt;nowiki&gt;What perplexes and bothers me is that so many people have so many things to say about so many topics, but when it comes to writing about a ''general'' topic, like [[music]], they feel compelled to...make a list.  For example, we can read reams of content about [[electronic music]], [[Irish traditional music]], [[rap music]], etc., but when we go to [[music]], we find not a single prose sentence describing what music is.  Nope--you can go look.  Not a single sentence.  Similarly with [[computing]], and a good number of other articles too, like [[film genres]] and [[actors]].  [[Computer]] simply directs the reader to [[computing]], as though the reader would not possibly want to know anything about computers in general.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;
The [[philosophy]] article was this way, too, for a good long time, until I decided to organize a few of those lists into prose sentences.  Lo and behold, a decent article emerged.  So, why don't we do that with all such articles-that-are-now-mere-lists-of-internal-links?  Yes, yes, it's easier to write a list.  I know.  Go thou and do whatever thou wilt.  But, as Spinoza said, &quot;All excellent things are as difficult as they are rare.&quot;  Inversely, all mediocre things are as easy as they are common.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I just felt inspired to make a list.  Here is a list of '''Things That Encyclopedia Articles Are Not:'''

See [[What Wikipedia is not]] for the latest list!
----
I agree with this completely, I am very glad I read it.  In the [[Stars]] article there are two LONG lists of stars, which seemed useless to me, but I hesitated to change them.  Now I am resolved to eliminate the list, perhaps replacing them with a sentence naming a couple of them.

[[Jmccann]]
-----
Well, I wouldn't eliminate the list unless it really is ''completely'' useless (I doubt that...).  But adding many paragraphs to give essential information about the items listed, well, that's a lot better than most lists, I think. --[[LMS]]
-----
Lists of links are not encyclopedia articles, but they are quite useful as navigation aids. I think we need real articles, but we need lists of links as well, and the lists should be at or near the top if they are on the same page as a real article, so we don't need to waste time scrolling down when using the list for navigation.

A certain encyclopedia that we shouldn't name, included lists of links even in it's paper versions of old. These usually had names like &quot;Agriculture, articles on&quot;. Perhaps we could adopt a similar naming scheme for our lists of links.

&lt;nowiki&gt;
[[Mathematics, articles on]] for the links page.
[[Mathematics]] for an actual article on mathematics in general, with a link to [[Mathematic, articles on]] right at the top.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
[[Geronimo Jones]]
----
&lt;nowiki&gt;
I said in the column that it's a good idea to have lists of links--just not as a replacement for actual articles.  I disagree about having the links first.  I think that if you're on a page about XYZ, you should reasonably be able to read an article about XYZ.  Links to other articles, while essential, are not as important as the article itself.  &quot;The content's the thing.&quot;  I think the idea of putting links on a separate page isn't a bad idea for a few topics--e.g., we might have a long article about actresses, generally, on [[actress]], but we might have a list of actresses on a separate page.  For subtopics of main topics, my bias would be to keep the links all on the same page as the text.  When you visit [[mathematics]] or [[philosophy]], you shouldn't ''expect'' to see a short article.  :-)&lt;/nowiki&gt; --[[LMS]]
----

I think lists are very useful.  Saying they are not encyclopedia articles means defining an encylopedia article based on what has been customary in the past, rather than in terms of an encylopedia's purpose.  If the purpose is to be an easy-to-access repository of human knowledge, then a list is an encyclopedia article.  The article on &lt;nowiki&gt;[[manned space missions]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, for example, is potentially very useful to anyone interested in that topic.  -[[TimShell|TS]]

-------------
&lt;nowiki&gt;
Lists are vital! They function as indices, and can also be used in the future to bootstrap [[metadata]] and [[category scheme]]s. They also provide ideas to writers of new articles. At worst, unless deliberately frivolous or vandalistic, they do no harm.&lt;/nowiki&gt; -- [[User:The Anome|The Anome]] 13:38, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)

'''Faith based arguments vs scientific reasoning.'''

I have participated on the [[w:NPOV]] discussions and this commentary is an attempt to clear the air and set some guidelines that others may find useful.

There are a number of controversies floating around the Wikipedia. In my opinion, the majority of the &quot;hard-to-resolve&quot; controversies have &quot;faith vs science&quot; at their foundation. This article seeks primarily to deal with those.

First let me distinguish between three types of controversies in the Wikipedia and eliminate those two categories not related to &quot;faith&quot; based arguments.

==Disputes about the evidence==
The &quot;flat earthers&quot;, &quot;scientologists&quot;, &quot;anti-relativitivists&quot; [[Simple 
Disproof of SR]], etc all challenge the accuracy of the evidence. They can be fairly reported without bias by saying &quot;here is the evidence&quot; and &quot;but regardless of the evidence these people don't believe it''. That's not bias, that's just fair reporting. These people are not disputing the validity of scientific reasoning, they are simply breaking the rules of the [[w:scientific method]] by failing to dismiss their theory in light of the evidence.

Likewise for &quot;[[w:JFK]] was not the president when the Bay of Pigs incident happened&quot; - wrong, wrong, wrong. He was and we can say so.

This is a clear defining element of [[w:pseudoscience]]. Consider this: Isaac Newton seriously investigated alchemy - was this pseudoscience? No it wasn't - in the 1600's there was no scientific evidence available to convince Newton he was chasing a blind alley. It was 400 plus years ago, and scientific news didn't travel fast. LOTS of people were chasing blind alleys... this is how science happens. Alchemy had to be investigated before it could be dismissed, and a lot of the early chemistry discoveries were made by alchemists.

However if I started investigating alchemy in 2001 that's very different. '''If''' I can present a radical new interpretation of both chemistry and particle physics that clearly accords with all known evidence yet still shows a path to transmutation, then fine. Otherwise, I am a crackpot.
:You are implicitly requiring new knowledge to be exclusively built on old, I think. That puts you in danger of negating the possibility of investigating a system from an old-fashioned point of view, even if that view has advantages, because you consider it to have been absolutely superceded.  If alchemical considerations have been neglected for 200 years or so, isn't it possible that re-examination of such ways of thinking could produce new insights, or at least add colour to ones understanding of a scientific system reduced to its bare bones by [[w:Occam's razor]] and [[w:Euclid|Euclidian]] axiomic systemetisation?

&lt;i&gt;(See also [[w:Protoscience]])&lt;/i&gt;

----

==Disputes about linguistics and semantics==

Generally these controversies are about what a term actually means. &quot;White Trash&quot;, &quot;International English&quot;, &quot;Anti-Americanism/Semiticism/Islam etc&quot; are classic examples. I presently have no absolutely ideas on how to resolve these. The only contribution I can make is where possible report the facts. &quot;Jews died in the holocaust&quot; is a fact, at least within the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard of law (There were bodies, official documents, eyewitness accounts etc). Reasons are a lot more difficult to present in an unbiased way.

:I think that the best way to resolve these is by writing articles about phenomenons, not about definitions. For example there are two definition of [[w:genocide]]: international law definition (narrow) and popular definition (broad). This problem could only be resolved by studying which definition fits better to described phenomenon (in this case a popular one).
::The meaning of the term in international law is the original meaning of the term, as the person who coined the term used it; the 'popular' meaning is more recent. And if one wants to study the broader phenomena, there are other terms (e.g. democide) which are better used instead, since they have only one meaning. The legal definition of genocide is preferable because it is the older and original meaning of the term, it was the meaning used by the person who coined the term and it stays faithful to the meaning of its Greek and Latin roots. In fact, though a few scholars do knowingly use the broader meaning, it is more 'popular' mainly due to misunderstanding. -- SJK

----
==Disputes based on principles of faith==

In my opinion, all of the '''real''' hell-raising (pardon the pun) controversies we are dealing with have religion vs science at their foundation. The &quot;faith vs scientific evidence&quot; conflict has existed for centuries and will continue to do so long after we are all dead. Science says &quot;scientific evidence is our best yardstick of truth-measurement&quot;. (This doesn't say that evidence IS &quot;the truth&quot;, it says it is the best thing we have.) A faith based argument rejects that principle.

Consider the argument &quot;God planted all scientific evidence to test our faith&quot;. We cannot argue with it. If we say &quot;There is no evidence to support that belief &quot; the reply is &quot;That is God's will&quot;. It is totally immune to reason or challenge. 

Religious beliefs of this kind '''challenge the very idea that scientific evidence is of any value'''. (This is not [[w:pseudoscience]] - pseudosciences are arguments that use scientific reasoning improperly.) Hence we cannot argue from reason - as it is &quot;reason&quot; itself that is being rejected. However - certain &quot;faith-based&quot; arguments are presented along pseudo-scientific lines, and they get (deservedly) torn to shreds accordingly.

Now the majority of writers at the Wikipedia believe in science, and scientific evidence (as do I) but a very large percentage of the world doesn't. It is NOT our place to dictate their beliefs. We can however present all scientific evidence, pay appropriate respect to non-scientific beliefs, and say &quot;you decide&quot;. This preserves neutrality.

As long as an argument is based on principles of faith, it is immune to scientific reasoning. Fine, that's how it is. When a faith-based argument attempts to use scientific reasoning to justify itself then we can (and should) tear it to pieces.

Whenever there is a faith-based counter-argument to an accepted scientific princple (eg. creationism) then we must in all fairness report that it exists, and treat it with respect and dignity. It is not contemptuous simply because ''we'' don't believe it. Hindus believe that there are multiple Gods, Christians believe we are going to heaven/hell/ etc. 

[[ManningBartlett|MB]]

Respect for Creationism and flat-earth etc. ?
Wouldn't it be better to respect intelligent readers ? --[[Taw]]
&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color = blue&gt; Why don't you actually read the article Taw - it specifically discounts flat-earth. And how do you respond to this statement of mine &quot;Whenever there is a faith-based counter-argument to an accepted scientific princple (eg. creationism) then we must in all fairness report that it exists, and treat it with respect and dignity.&quot; Are you saying that all religious viewpoints should be ignored? &lt;/font&gt;

I think creationism and flat-earthism are different. Flat-earthism is so obviously false, that only people in isolated Himalayan villages or the totally irrational believe it. But the evidence for evolution is much less secure than the evidence that the earth is round. So I don't think we need show any respect for flat-earthers, though I think we need show somewhat more respect for creationists. But I think Wikipedia should clearly give preference to mainstream scientific opinion over creationism. -- SJK

I see no difference between creationism and flat-earth. Ask random biologists if they see it, probably they also won't.
Evolution is just a fact. I'd even say that it's better checked than shape of earth. [[Taw]] &lt;font color = blue&gt; I wasn't aware we were only writing for biologists. A lot of hindus, buddhists, fundamentalist christians, etc seriously reject evolution on the basis that they reject ALL methods of gathering scientific information, evolution included. - see below discussion - MB &lt;/font&gt;

: [''note: [[w:Buddhist|Buddhist]]s generally accept scientific reasoning; in particular, creationist beliefs would be seen as irrelevant and perhaps even meaningless.  Evolution would also seem irrelevant, but less so: it fits the evidence given by the observable world.  [[w:Hinduism|Hinduism]] does not seriously object to other beliefs, but is likely to support evolution because that is indistinguishable from Hindu beliefs about [[w:reincarnation|reincarnation]].'']

That's an exaggeration, but evolution is at least as well checked as any of the best physics theories of today.  However, the npov advocates have a good point: simply ignoring the existance of dissent doesn't help us.  If anything, it helps the dissenters, by making it look like their position is something we have failed to consider.  I suggest we keep to the ''de facto'' standard: biology pages can discuss the evolution of a particular group in peace, while pages on evolution should point out exactly what the dispute is and why it is one-sided.  Then everyone is happy.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color = blue&gt; Agreed. A page on biology doesn't need to justify its scientific position as it is obviously written from within the scientific framework. The page on evolution should, however, examine the contentiousness of the issue. - MB &lt;/font&gt;
----

In the last few days, I have noted a lobby to shift Wikipedia from NPOV to Scientific POV. I believe such a shift would be harmful to the project, especially if non-scientific beliefs are branded as bunk and adherants of them are ridiculed. I'll refrain from elaborating on how immensly tactless and uninformed it is to infer that believers in non-scientific systems are less intelligent than scientific minded persons. The first problem with this POV shift is that it could lead to endless edit wars. The second is that it will scare people with much to contribute away, much as seeing any hostile environment would. The third is that a creeping intolerance could be introduced which could end up in ever increasing bias.

I firmly believe (more belief here :-) that NPOV is a very good practice, one that we may actually outperform older encyclopedias in. No science will ever be perverted through NPOV, rather to the contrary: Reporting on contrary views can only strenghten the scientific view, since evidence will be lacking for all other views. I simply cannot understand the worry that people might be &quot;misled&quot; by a NPOV article. It's like arguing that people need protection from horrible communist ideas, lest the world become [[evil]]: That is something belonging in  the Hoover era. Presenting all views and letting people make up their minds on what seems most likely &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be the way to go.

As for the &quot;emphasis by volume&quot; argument: That a meaty article on creationism and a sparse on darwinism might lead to people jumping on the creationism bandwagon, and that this must at any cost be stopped. I can only say: Write a good article on darwinism!  On an aside, the present &quot;emphasis by volume&quot; on western ideas, philosophy, history, and innumerable other subjects is massive, but I don't find this disheartening: As more and more people flock to our Wiki, those subjects lacking coverage will be fleshed out, and take their right place.

Enough ranting for one day :-) --Anders Törlind
:&lt;font color=blue&gt;Hear, hear (commonwealth-speak for &quot;you are absolutely right&quot;) - MB &lt;/font&gt;

I think that we should stop calling it NPOV. We're choosing between Reality POV and Believes POV now.
I'm strongly for RPOV. [[Taw]]

&lt;font color=blue&gt;Taw - then you are in the minority. &quot;Belief-based knowledge systems&quot; are held by the general majority of the world. The world does not predominately consist of white, middle-class educated westerners. If someone else wrote &quot;I am clearly in favour of a Belief-based POV&quot; you would get VERY self-righteous. 

The fact is, people believe in different things. Our job is to report on the belief systems accurately, present the evidence as fairly as we can and leave it at that. If we write an article that says &quot;The science of evolution says this... the evidence is this...(etc) do you honestly think that a fundamentalist Christian is going to read and go &quot;Oh my God - I was wrong all the time!&quot;. If you read an article that presents the fundamentalist viewpoint on Creationism are you going to go &quot;Oh my God - they're right!&quot;. It ain't going to happen - people will believe what they believe. 

What is upsetting you is the statement that &quot;Science is a belief system&quot;. Here is a sample discussion between you and a &quot;faither&quot; (a word I made up as a catch-all term for people who adhere to faith-based belief systems):

::(You) - &quot;Science is the best way of viewing the world&quot;. 
::(Faither) - &quot;No, my belief system is the best way&quot;
::(You) - &quot;But I've got incontrovertible evidence&quot; 
::(faither) - &quot;I've got incontrovertible evidence too&quot;. 
::(You) - &quot;My evidence is scientific!&quot; 
::(faither) - &quot;We reject the scientific method of gathering evidence. All knowledge comes from God.&quot;
::(You) - &quot;That's nonsense - there's no evidence for that&quot;
::(Faither) - &quot;The evidence is in the &lt;nowiki&gt;Bible/Koran/Whatever&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;
::(You) - &quot;That's just a book someone wrote&quot;
::(faither) - &quot;Science is just a bunch of stuff someone made up&quot;
::(You) - &quot;No, the evidence is scientific!&quot; 
::(faither) - &quot;We reject the scientific method...(etc)&quot;
::(You) - &quot;Well, you're wrong&quot;
::(faither) - &quot;No, '''you're''' wrong...
::''repeat ad nauseum''

You will argue that '''you''' are right. They will argue that '''they''' are right. You are trapped in your own prejudice. They are trapped in theirs.

So shall we go with &quot;weight of numbers&quot;? Well then we have to remove ALL scientific accounts. A lot more people believe in reincarnation than in evolution. Oh sorry, did you mean we are should only count middle-class educated westerners? Ahh, so the 900 million hindus aren't relevant? That's very dangerous ground... - MB &lt;/font&gt;

:There's a semantic element to this dispute as well: most people who take this position are using a bizarre definition of &quot;science&quot;. The above argument is only valid if you interpret &quot;science&quot; to mean &quot;the present state of scientific inquiry and practice&quot;, or &quot;the current practices and beliefs of working scientists&quot;; i.e., a static definition.  But science is dynamic by its very nature, and independent of the beliefs of its practitioners.  The difference between science and faith in the argument above is that at some point the scientist will ask the question: &quot;OK, so you believe X. What event would cause you to change your belief?&quot;  The faither cannot answer; the scientist can: &quot;I'll change as soon as I see convincing evidence to the contrary&quot;. The Faither just says, &quot;Well, the book says X, so I believe X, no matter what&quot;. Faith is, by its very nature then, incapable of correcting its errors, incapable of growing and learning and improving. Some individual scientists may be crippled by faith as well, but science as a whole is not.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker]]
::Agreed, if one holds that evidence is impossible or unhelpful, one is bound to end up with absurd and funny beliefs.  However, this is not the case with all practitioners of &quot;faith based systems.&quot; And I think it would be absurd and somewhat insulting to claim otherwise. Personally I believe in the existence of an unmoved mover, a first cause, or a non-contingent being, a God, or whatever you want to call it, which &quot;caused&quot; the big bang.  I don't claim that this belief is arrived at by properly scientific evidence, but I'd also claim that its refutation can't be justified based on the currently available scientific evidence. If that's the case and I'm pretty sure it is, then other kinds of philosophical or experiential evidence may be important in deciding the question.  This is not to say that I refuse to change my mind based on evidence, but that I don't accept science as the final arbiter of all truth.  Moreover, as I have argued extensively, I think that there are propositions which must be accepted by scientists prior to doing any scientific research which cannot be justified on purely scientific evidence.  If that is the case, science cannot be held up as the one and only method for arriving at truth, at least not until all other systems have been adequately tried and found wanting, which is an exhausting task to even contemplate.  [[MRC]]
Also the key difference between scientific thought and faith based thought is that scientific thought is able to predict future experiments.  It is mighty hard to build a machine that will accomplish some new feat based purely upon what is contained in the Bible, or to predict when god is going to perform his next miracle.  This is the key difference in the argument between the scientist and the faither, and why the two cannot be seen as equal. - MPL

&lt;font color=brown&gt; Seems I may have somehow by being stubborn in my faith based article on [[w:New Age]] and saw the &quot;science guys&quot; trashing my material, been a part of MB's article here. If more people RTFM and go visit good editors'(like MB) personal pages or check his ideas they will have learned to write with others effectively and not destroy the project with massive deletions. &lt;/font&gt;
:BF - Wikipedia is not the place to evangelize your beliefs, as many people have tried to explain to you. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

==Is Science faith based?==
Fundamentally, I think this whole argument is misconstrued.  Specifically I think there's a false dichotomy which everybody seems to be taking for granted.  I don't think the distinction being drawn between &quot;faith based system&quot; and &quot;science&quot; works in the real world.  Scientific enquiry requires that one hold beliefs which can't themselves be demonstrated by science. Included in this category are fundamental beliefs, such as the belief that every event has a sufficient cause, the belief that the cause/effect relationships seen in the past will hold in the future, and that mathematical models (if well construed) accurately map to real world events.  None of these beliefs can be founded on scientific evidence because they are presupposed by the scientific method.  Of course, I think it reasonable to accept these beliefs as true, even without &quot;evidence&quot; (at least not evidence which could be considered &quot;scientific&quot;).  But I think the fact the these basic presuppositions are accepted without &quot;strong&quot; evidence means that &quot;science&quot; is just another faith based systems.

And I'm sure an even stronger case can be made that the wider understanding of &quot;scientific naturalism&quot; which is generally a conflation of methodological and philosophical naturalism, relies on assumptions which it absolutely cannot prove.  But even if we reject the naturalism which is often implied by those who argue for &quot;science&quot; over and against  &quot;faith based&quot; system, I think it is clear that we still need to evaluate the reliability of the truth claims which proceed from the assumptions scientists make.  Of course, this is true of other &quot;faith based&quot; systems as well.    

If that's true, then the whole &quot;scientific&quot; verses &quot;faith based&quot; distinction needs to be revisited.  Scientific enquiry is just ''one of the most reliable'' faith based systems.  And it cannot be assumed on [[w:a priori]] grounds to be more accurate than any other system investigating the facts, and that is exactly why I oppose the current trend on the wikipedia to ignore competing intellectual systems.  Perhaps in some or all cases,  a fair reporting of all the sides on a particular issue will reveal so much more evidence in the favor of the scientific view that there will be no question of which view is correct, but this is not a question on which we have the right to prejudge the issue.  Especially when the majority of the human beings who are now alive, and the majority of human beings who ever lived would have serious disagreements with a worldview entierly based in scientific naturalism. 

Now, beyond that, I think there are some comments in the above argument which misconstrue the nature of religious belief and it's relationship with scientific enquiry.  Many, if not most religious folks I know believe in the value and utility of the scientific method, but they claim that it has limits .  This is why it is important to cover all sides of the controversial issues, because it's not that &quot;religious belief&quot; (what you've been calling &quot;faith based systems&quot;) are fundamentally opposed to the scientific method, but that there are points of tension, and those points of tension are often very hotly debated, and generally interesting and important from a philosophical point of view.  To ignore these particular debates is to ignore the possibility that the scientific method may actually have particular kinds of limits.  Alternately, ignoring the debate is to preclude  the possibility that the scientific method could adequate to the task of reliably producing testable truth claims in that area.   

My point is that I am strongly opposed to the idea that we should have a &quot;scientific point of view&quot; which is the basis for everything we write at the wikipedia.  I feel strongly enough about the issue that I'd be willing to try to create another online free wiki based encyclopedia which does not have that restriction.  A project which is somewhat reasonable since the content at the wikipedia could simply be migrated over. [[MRC]]

--'''I moved this whole discussion to it's own section for readability, and reformated a bit'''--
:Fundamentally, I think this whole argument is misconstrued.  Specifically I think there's a false dichotomy which everybody seems to be taking for granted.  I don't think the distinction being drawn between &quot;faith based system&quot; and &quot;science&quot; works in the real world.  &lt;font color=green&gt;Scientific enquiry requires that one hold beliefs which can't themselves be demonstrated by science.&lt;/font&gt;  Included in this category are fundamental beliefs, such as the belief that every event has a sufficient cause, the belief that the cause/effect relationships seen in the past will hold in the future, and that mathematical models (if well construed) accurately map to real world events.

But I think the fact the these basic presuppositions are accepted without &quot;strong&quot; evidence means that &quot;science&quot; is just another faith based systems.

The statement I have highlighted in green above is completely, 100%, absolute, falsehood.  Furthermore, its falsity has been clearly demonstrated and explained many times, so continuing to express it is either (1) ignorant of what science really is; (2) dishonest, malicious, and slanderous to real scientists; or (3) itself a dogmatic belief with no evidence.  Science is nothing more or less than simple honesty; it is the personal commitment to view the world as it is instead of how you want it to be, and to hold beliefs that are consistent with what you actually see in the world, changing them as necessary.  There are no axioms; no articles of faith; no sacred texts; no inviolate practices.  The particular ones you state (causality, consistency, accurate mapping) are not only not assumed by scientists, but they are explicity rejected in many cases where they don't hold (Quantum mechanics violates a lot of them, for example: certain quantum events don't have a &quot;cause&quot;, only a probability of occurence, and multiple trials of the same experiment will not produce the same results, only results consistent with the probability distributions).  Further, scientists explicity disclaim that the mapping of mathematical models to reality is &quot;true&quot; or &quot;accurate&quot; in any sense; they only claim that it is useful, because it has accomplished things.  This has been repeated clearly so many times that you can't possibly claim not to have heard and understood it, so to claim otherwise is a deliberately deceitful tactic to attack a distorted view of your opponent's position instead of his actual views, and is beneath the dignity of honest debate.  It is pointless to debate this further with you until you demonstrate the basic personal integriy to either retract these statements, or to admit that they are a personal belief of yours held in direct opposition to what scientists themselves claim. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker]]

:First of all, I am a reliablist of sorts, and believe that we ought to use whatever belief formation system produces true knowledge.  I think that it is ''interesting'' that you simply define science as believing in the world as it is.  I myself would have to resort to a listing of the standard practices, theories, and methodologies of actual scientists to accurately define science.  If on the other hand I just wanted to define science as an unassailable absolute, I might just propose exactly the definition you did.  But I agree that we should avoid using a &quot;a deliberately deceitful tactic to attack a distorted view of your opponent's position instead of his actual views.&quot;  We'll never get anywhere slinging mud. 

:But this goes both ways.  So I am just going to say, that I do not accept your definition of a &quot;scientific point of view.&quot;  Look I am not arguing against using reliable criteria to judge the truth value of statements, nor am I arguing that science as it is commonly practiced does a great job of this in many areas, and that it will get better in the areas where it currently is struggling.  What I will argue is that it is '''''possible''' that reliable truth production methods may be available which are not a part of scientific practice.''  For example, if there is a divine being who knows stuff about the world and he/she communicates that knowledge to somebody in a reliable way, that would certainly count as a good knowledge production mechanism, but I don't think you'd want to call it science. So let's come define science more accurately, or else this discussion is going nowhere and going very fast.

:That said, your rebuttal to my three &quot;presuppositions&quot; is worth discussing.  You claim that &quot;quantum physics&quot; has shown that scientists don't assume the principle of causality.  I am no quantum physicist, nor are you, but from what I've read on the subject, quantum events are caused, but not determined.  This may seem like an idle distinction, but quantum events happen according to rules, and those rules are consistent over time, and we mathematically predicted those rules before we ever had a chance to verify them experimentally.  I take it that the principles of ''causality'', ''consistency'', and ''accuracy'' are still fundamental to quantum physics, even if they are slightly altered from the simple principles we had before we discovered the seriously strange &quot;laws&quot; of quantum physics. 
 
:And you might notice that there are still a good number of realists amongst scientists, who do actually want to claim that scientific theories actually do describe the way the &quot;world really works&quot; and aren't just ''mental models.''  And with some reservations I would side with them against their anti-realist objectors.  (FYI, I think Kuhn accurately describes a real phenomenon in science, but I reject his statement that scientific theories '''necessarily'' contain arbitrary ellements.) We may disagree about the possibility of a faith based system which is reliable, but please, lay off on the ad hominum attacks. [[MRC]]

::Sure, there are a few scientists who say that they are finding &quot;truth&quot; or that their models are &quot;real&quot;; just as there are quite a few doctors selling snake oil.  But the fact is that the ''overwhelming'' majority of scientists ''do not'' claim that they seek &quot;truth&quot;, or that their models are &quot;reality&quot;.  That is a solid fact, clearly expressed by the vast majority of writings on the subject, and one that I am sure you know well.  To continue to claim otherwise is dishonest.  If I hear some random man-on-the-street say &quot;those scientists think they know everything&quot;, I can forgive his ignorance, because he probably hasn't spent a lot of time with real scientists to know how totally non-comittal they are.  But you know better.  I can suffer fools gladly, but liars are harder to tolerate.  And use your terminology correctly: an &quot;ad hominem&quot; fallacy is to argue that ''what some person says'' is false because that person is bad in some way; I am not doing that.  I am making the assertion that you are lying, for which it is necessary to also show that the statement you are making is false--but I am not saying it is false ''because'' of who are, only that (1) it is false (for other reasons), and (2) you claim it is true.  That sounds like an ''ad hominem'', but it's a rational accusation. --LDC

:::Alright, enough with the personal attacks.  I am not lying.  I have some experience working in the philosophy of science, and every time I tried to do interdisciplinary work with ''actual scientists'' I ended up getting lectured about why people like Kuhn are idiots, and that scientific work isn't really ''just mental models''.  Particular umbrage was taken at Kuhn's claim that these mental models have arbitrary elements.  I don't have an empirical data on what scientists actually believe, how well educated they are on the subject, or even if they are using the terminology correctly, but my experience is that there are quite a few people out there who get pissed off about the anti-realists, and who claim that their theories explain &quot;real things as they really are in the real world!&quot; (exact quote)  None the less, I am sure you are correct that most scientists don't believe this.  I'm sure that as a philosopher I attracted the attention of folks with an axe to grind, whereas those who weren't upset by Kuhn just did their work, and talked to me reasonably about the subject at hand. 

:::Anyway, I don't think it really matters that much.  Look, I'm convinced that lots of scientists don't talk the way you describe, and lots do.  I'd even agree that most scientists believe that their theories aren't &quot;True&quot; with a capital T, but there are a small (but vocal) group who do that still.  I also think the extreme form of this is kind of absurd, but I think there's a large middle group, who subscribe to a moderate-realism with respect to scientific theories, and I would at least tentatively place myself in that group as well. And that's the group I was talking about originally. In short I think the &quot;moderate realist&quot; position is that scientific theories are mental models, but that our &quot;cognitive apparatus&quot; is properly attenuated to be able to reliably map those mental models to the real world, in such a way that they are both accurate models, and in a real and important sense descriptive of what actually takes place in the world of &quot;things as they are.&quot;  I tend to see this operating principle behind lots of scientific work, and I'm not suppressed by it as it seems to be very sensible attitude to me. On the other hand, I think we should agree that most ''practicing scientists'' '''don't have the time''' or desire to articulate a clear view on such an obscure philosophical subject, when they have real work to do.  So whatever we say on this subject, I think a little more humility than you've shown (calling me a liar) is in order. [[MRC]]

::OK, maybe--just maybe--you honestly believe that what you're saying reflects what you really believe, in which case you're just not saying it well.  I've read Kuhn as well as Popper, and while I think he's just saying the same sorts of things in more pretentious language, I don't think he's a crackpot.  But let's get back to the purpose here: what kinds of statements belong in an encyclopedia?  I'm happy to report on just about anyone's belief, no matter how small a minority, but the statement I colored in green above, or statements that scientist believe their models are &quot;real&quot;, are ''exactly'' the kinds of statements I think have no place here at all, because that's a statement (expressed as unadorned fact) about what a group of people believe that is the exact opposite of what most of them, in fact, believe.  It is no less offensive than saying that Muslims believe Christians should be killed (though no doubt you could find hundreds of examples of exactly that).  True, most scientists don't spend a lot of time on philosophy, because they are too busy doing ordinary work; but if you honestly asked the simple question about what they see as &quot;truth&quot;, probably not 1 in 5 would say that their models are &quot;actual reality&quot;, and half of those who did say that would recant if pressed and just say that they were using the language in a convenient way rather than with philosophical rigor.  I've fought this kind of nonsense with creationists and other idiots for years--it's disheartening to have to fight it with another seemingly rational person.  As for documentation about the beliefs of ordinary scientists--just pick up any textbook, or go to a science web site for kids.  Any of them that go to the trouble to have something about &quot;what is science&quot; will all go out of their way to distance themselves from any claim that science represents metaphysical truth.  It's so common it's almost a cliche, and the attacks of the idiots who spout &quot;science claims to be the only way to truth...&quot; are equally tiresome, whether they do it from ignorance or deceit.  If I caught you unjustly in my wrath, please clarify what it is you actually believe. --LDC

:::Here's the deal, I don't have time to describe my beliefs on the subject in enough detail to appease you, but there are a few points I want to make, which I hope will help clarify my position.

:::*I believe that the scientific method is useful and valuable, and that it is a reliable truth production method for the areas of knowledge that it covers.  Though I am not convinced that every question scientists attempt to answer is actually answerable by science.
:::*I believe most scientists realize that their theories are just mental models, but that they do want to make some connection between those mental models and the &quot;real world.&quot;  It is this position which I call moderate realism, as opposed to the anti-realist position that reality is &quot;at bottom&quot; socially constructed, or hyper-realism, which is the position that our scientific theories are ontologically identical to the &quot;laws of nature.&quot;
:::*I believe that it is logically possible that there are other reliable truth production methods are not &quot;scientific&quot; and the only way to settle the issue is to look at the actual facts in question.  

:::That said, I stand by what I originally wrote.  The statement you highlighted in green above is my considered opinion about the way science works, I would never express such an opinion as NPOV, I only expressed it here, in response to taw, and others objections to the inclusion of &quot;faith based&quot; systems in the wikipedia.  As I said before I dont object to science and the scientific method, but I do object to the naturalist philosophy that is advocated in the name of science by some scientists. 

:::If you are familiar with what has been happening in philosophy over the last 40 or so years, you may understand what I mean when I say that I believe that foundationalism is no longer a tenable philosophical position, and that this leaves us in a position where we have multiple debatable positions and that the only way to evaluate between them is to consider them in totality as explanatory systems.  We cant just reject them because they disagree with our basic presuppositions, and this includes the rejection of &quot;faith based systems&quot; based on naturalistic assumptions. 

:::I am in the middle of a major network infrastructure upgrade this week, so I dont have time to write anything clearer than the above, which I am certain does not exactly explain what I believe in terminology which is comfortable to you, but if you want more, Id be glad to clarify my position sometime after the end of this week (or next week if things fall apart).

MRC writes: &lt;i&gt;&quot;Scientific enquiry is just one of the most reliable faith based systems.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;   AFAIC, &quot;reliability&quot; is precisely the issue. The Scientific Method and the institution of Science produce very reliable results (especially when iterated over time). Other systems may produce &quot;amusing&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;pleasing&quot; results, but if we want to maintain that they are &quot;reliable&quot; we can only do this by reference to Science.  The word for the territory we are in when we go beyond Science and the Scientific Method is &quot;unsubstantiated guessing&quot;, to be charitable, or &quot;blowing smoke&quot;, to be frank. 
----

That certainly is frank.  But not necessarily accurate.  It certainly does not address the issue itself, it only restates your position that those who do not subscribe to philosophical naturalism cannot possibly have defensible reasons to believe such things.  

As to the question of &quot;scientific method&quot; being the only way to verify the reliability of a given truth generating system, I'm absolutely certain this is not true.  Perhaps you are a member of the heaven's gate cult, and you believe that some kind of alien starship is going to arrive on a particular date, with a particular intention.  You don't need to do measurements, set up a control group, and attempt to perform some kind of quantitative analysis to recognize that those aliens did not arrive on that date.   The scientific method is useful, but it is extremely strange to say that it is the only possible criterion by which the truth or falsity of a particular truth claim can be judged.   

I also think that the fact that a truth claim was arrived at by &quot;scientific&quot; means does not necessarily make that claim accurate, and we can sometimes verify that inaccuracy without reference to further scientific inquiry.  Here's just one example:  Exclusive same sex attraction is evolutionarily maladaptive, since it is a trait which tends to decrease its own propagation.  But a simple observation with no &quot;scientific&quot; basis seems to clearly indicate that it not only exists but is present in the human population in non-trivial numbers.  So, clearly in this case, it is the argument from evolutionary science, and not the pre-scientific awareness that there is such a thing as same sex attraction which needs revisiting. (And of course there are lots of ways of revisiting the issue, which is not the point.  Certainly scientific inquiry can be amended to fit the &quot;facts,&quot; but that does not mean that it gets to be the final and only arbiter of what is and is not a &quot;fact.&quot;) [[MRC]] 
----
This may be relevant, depending on your interest. Kekule, who &quot;discovered&quot; the ring structures of organic compounds, states his insight came from several dreams, and on awakening worked from the memory of the dream to revolutionize Chemistry. (see http://step.sdsc.edu/projects95/chem.in.history/essays/kekule.html )&lt;BR&gt; Who can then exclude the importance of any information, &lt;i&gt;regardless of its apparent source&lt;/i&gt;, on Wiki? Dreamers as well as those who claim to &quot;know The Truth&quot;, fit very well into the New Age Point of View(NAPOV), like Kekule, and by &quot;homogeniz(s)ing&quot; content here into vanilla NPOV, are we not really limiting interaction by editing key words or performing selective semantical editing ? To allow ideas to flourish encourages growth; to white-out uncomfortable context facilitates decay.  -- Anon

----

I was talking about &lt;i&gt;reliabilty&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe we are using this word in different senses. 

So Kekule dreamed that Benzene was a ring. Maybe Lekule dreamed that it was shaped like an 8 and Mekule dreamed that it was shaped like the letter K. Why did other scientists come to &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; Kekule's dream? Because he could &lt;i&gt;prove&lt;/i&gt; it! Or at least offer evidence that they considered sufficiently persuasive.

Let me add another category to what we imagine and can't prove: Art. I imagine that Australia is about to sink into the sea. Thrilling idea. Maybe I can make a book or a movie or a painting out of it. I try to convince you that you should move from your home in Sydney because of the threat. Hopefully, you're going to ask me for some kind of evidence beyond my dream, hypothesis, painting, story plot, or whatever. If I can't produce any kind of evidence, then I'm &quot;guessing&quot;, &quot;blowing smoke&quot;, or &quot;creating art&quot;, but you have no reason to go along with my vision.

How do you define a &quot;fact&quot;?

----
I didn't write the paragraph about the benzene rings, but since I wrote the section before it, I'll take a stab at defining a fact.  A fact is a piece of knowlege, knowlege is information which has been produced by a relable information producing mechanism.  But as I said above, I believe that scinece is genneraly such a mechanism, but it is not the only such mechanism, nor is it absolutely reliable in every possible area of knowlege.  

Evidence is important, since it is genneraly required to convince others that such and such is the case, but I maybe warranted in believing some things without evidence, just because my &quot;mental equipment&quot; is designed (by millions of years of evolution, or a divine mind) to reliably produce such beliefs -- the belief in other minds is one very common example of used to explain this, I can't prove that there are other minds besides my own, but I am still warranted in believing it. [[MRC]]

BF replied to comments in the paragraph which includes the sentence &quot;AFAIC, 'reliability' is precisely the issue.&quot; (BF, I moved your comment. Not trying to be rude, I just think the page works better this way. Peace.)

:&lt;i&gt;&quot;The word for the territory&quot; is your viewpoint that Science and the Scientific Method are sacred cows.  Reliable or not, your viewpoint is a belief system that happens to be widely accepted, and also predictable. (As your remarks remain so narrow, one can only &quot;see right through you&quot; because you have made the first mistake by continuing the polarity. Other systems regard science as workable, and they do not continue some anti-science polarization. I think your view can NOT be truly a scientific view simply because any established scientific fact must remain open to scrutiny, based on new evidence, that not being a personal disregard or phobia for non clinical studies or experimentation)&lt;/i&gt; ~BF

My reply to BF: 

:&lt;i&gt;your viewpoint that Science and the Scientific Method are sacred cows.&lt;/i&gt;

I'd say I hold them in very high regard.    

&lt;i&gt;Reliable or not, your viewpoint is a belief system that happens to be widely accepted, and also predictable.&lt;/i&gt;

I don't understand what you mean here. &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; is predictable, or &lt;i&gt;my viewpoint&lt;/i&gt; is predictable? If it's my viewpoint that is predictable, this isn't very relevant (ad hominem argument). If it's Science and the results of Science that are predictable, this is the point.


&lt;i&gt;(As your remarks remain so narrow, one can only &quot;see right through you&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

I don't understand what you mean here. 

&lt;i&gt;Other systems regard science as workable, and they do not continue some anti-science polarization.&lt;/i&gt;

I don't understand what you mean here. Examples, maybe?

&lt;i&gt;any established scientific fact must remain open to scrutiny, based on new evidence&lt;/i&gt;

I strongly agree. 

&lt;i&gt;that not being a personal disregard or phobia for non clinical studies or experimentation)&lt;/i&gt; 

The crux is: if our evidence isn't produced by clinical studies, experimentation, or the like, how do we demonstrate to others whether they would be right to agree with us or not? I'd really like to know your answer to this.

If someone would like to give a concise summary of the arguments here and on other new pages critical of [[neutral point of view]], I would be only too happy to reply to that.  I am firmly persuaded that very many objections to a nonbias policy stem from a failure to understand it properly.  On the general subject of this page, I would like to encourage you to read what I wrote [[w:Creationism/Talk|here]]. --[[LMS]]

(Apparently &quot;Larry's Big Reply&quot; [AKA The Ten Point Plan  :-)] on [[w:Creationism/Talk]])

It may also be the 10 Step Plan. Alikened to the famous 12 Step Plan for AAA, the 10 Step Plan is a meeting for people who are wikipediaholics whose addiction lies in edition, not writing. Copyeditors who have no original ideas and choose to &quot;correct&quot; someone's work. This behavior is not unlike children mimicing and mocking, &quot;You said 'gump'. It's 'jump', stupid ! Na nanananaaaa.&quot; And at the 10 step meeting held in the church basement owned by Jimmy Wales, all anonymously drink neutral de-caff tea even though they have this wicked craving for the natural tea(with caffeine) and some even drink &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green tea&lt;/font&gt; to spite everyone, then anonymous Larry begins the meeting: &quot; Hello my name is NPOV Larry, i'm a wikipediaholic.&quot; They all respond, &quot;Hello Larry.&quot; Then the next person chimes( or is it chymes, as in the sickening short intestinal fluid that smells, created by regurgitation, adding HCl, and mixing with bile), &quot;Hello my name is NPOV Axel, i'm a wikipediaholic.&quot; &quot;Hello Axel.&quot; and on and on we go, where we stop only the cd burners know. ~BF

----

I didn't read ALL the comments, so sorry if i'm being redundant, but most of those comments up there are basically the same.
Anyhow I'd like to express my views.
Disclaimer-I'm trying I'm 17 and its kinda hard to be completly responsible all the time) to be a devout christian, not with this post specifically, but with life in general .

Flat Earth - You do realize that this is one of those things science 
produced.If a religion anno 500 B.C. would claim the earth was round,
it would be seen as stupid.The notion that the earth was flat was completly scientific, no religion claimed it, observations showed the earth must be flat.If the earth was round then non of the known 'theories' would work.
Similarly if a religion had proposed in 1700 that the speed of light was constant it would also be dismissed as something only 'stupid' people could believe.And highly intelligent greek philosophers thaught energy was needed to keep motion, consistent with observations.
The thing is I don't believe the Bible (or whatever religious book have you) should be about science, but rather about lifestyle.
Can you see early jewish heads exploding if Genesis started-'In the beginning the basic force and particle were created and formed a big bang which in a second expanded into the current universe'.
Sure the bible could explain evolution or, according to Wolfram, CA, but back in those early days people wouldn't have grasped the concept and why would God want to confuse us with details?
Don't you think it's conceivable that he put down his magic wand and used his ultimate knowledge of physics/chemistry/biology to create a planet with life in a more plausable way?
The idea behind religion ASFAIK is lifestyle.
The bible teaches how to live a healthy lifestyle.
Some things may sound silly, like Jews not being allowed to eat pork and shrimp, but science shows that these meats are 'dirty', they have chemicals in them and humans are likely to get pimpels and infections.Logical actually if you consider what these animals eat, they're natures vacuum cleaners.
And other things also make logical sense, like the ten commandments.
One thing I do know is that when i follow the teachings of the bible I'm 
happier and since I 'found' Jesus about two years ago my life has changed alot, for the better.
Sure you could argue that I fell better because i believe i'm doing the right thing.
I'd beg to differ, but on that I don't have real evidence.
Anyway the way I see it;
   God isn't a magical being, but a supreme being with supreme knowledge.
he doesn't wave a magical wand, but uses supreme knowledge.
Just as i'm not magical when I cook water with microwaves, although it would appear so to ancient greeks for example and explaining the phenomenon would be much more work then saying it was magic and the work wouldn't be worth it if i needed to give them the hot water and not the science lessons.
   Religion is about lifestyle, not science.
   Everything in the bible is true AND all scientific findings are true.
If they contradict each other, then either we misinterpreted the bible.
AND/OR we misinterpreted the scientific findings.
AND/OR we're comparing apples to oranges.

Reading my post I guess I went a bit of topic.
Oh well no such things as a invalid opinion I say.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thursday, July 19, 2001, 4:33 PM -- As you probably know, Wikipedia's peer-reviewed cousin, Nupedia, has been producing articles ''much'' more slowly than Wikipedia. The Nupedia project is very proud of its carefully-developed peer-review system, but it has become clear to many Nupedians that it poses so many roadblocks to progress, that some change is necessary if Nupedia is to become useful anytime soon--some change, but without sacrificing quality.

Having seen Wikipedia's very real success, we've decided, as at least an experiment, to set up a wiki of our own, which we're calling our &quot;Chalkboard&quot;:

:http://chalkboard.nupedia.com/

This will, we hope, provide a lot of new high-quality content for Nupedia. Soon, we are going to announce the Chalkboard to the over 3,000 subscribers to Nupedia's newsletter. Just a few minutes ago, I announced it to Nupedia's Advisory-l, Nupedia-l, and General-l mailing lists.

So, what relationship do I envision between Wikipedia and the Chalkboard? Basically, I hope that, when an article on Wikipedia seems to be of a very high quality, the person mainly responsible for it will post it on the Chalkboard. There, we hope, it will be vetted by many more experts than there are on Wikipedia (not, of course, that we haven't got our fair share of experts on this and that here). Authorship should be worked out on a &lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt; page before transferring it.

The Chalkboard will be able to supply Wikipedia with articles as well--as long as they are &quot;live&quot; articles. Chalkboard articles-in-progress, unless they started life on Wikipedia, shouldn't be copied to Wikipedia until they've been approved by Nupedia.

The existence of this cluster of websites, Wikipedia, the Chalkboard, and the main Nupedia site is, we realize, an imperfect division of labor, but each website does have a distinct purpose. Wikipedia exists as a place where any articulate person can come and offer what knowledge he or she has, and have that work critiqued by other people who find the open environment congenial. The Chalkboard exists as a place where experts can ''easily'' collaborate on articles, in a managed and demanding, but still largely open setting. Wikipedia and the Chalkboard can easily exchange material. Wikipedia is probably always going to be the fastest-growing part of the cluster, on the vanguard, as it were. It can only benefit from the results of the work of the many people who might be willing to work on the Chalkboard, but not on Wikipedia. Nupedia, meanwhile, is the slowest-moving but doubtless the highest-quality of the cluster. Its purpose, as we see it, is to act as a careful, professional approval mechanism for articles, including (and later, perhaps especially) articles that begin life on the Chalkboard--and therefore, for articles that begin life on Wikipedia.

For this reason, it is much less likely that Wikipedia will ''ever'' get anything like an article approval mechanism of its own, because that is what the Wikipedia-Chalkboard-Nupedia path will constitute.

--[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----

What is the difference between a &quot;live&quot; chalkboard article, and
article-in-progress? Is it that the a-i-p is already going
through the Nupedia editorial process? And a &quot;live&quot; article
is before that stage? I just copied an article from there, and
i'm not sure if I should erase it.
----
Edits to an article on the Chalkboard are discouraged, if that article has become article-in-progress in the ''Nupedia system.'' A live article is an article that's been approved and posted on the main Nupedia website (not the Chalkboard). So the process might go something like this, in ''some'' cases: Wikipedia --&gt; Chalkboard --&gt; Nupedia system (&quot;article in progress&quot;) --&gt; Nupedia (&quot;live article,&quot; approved and posted) --&gt; Chalkboard (posted with a notice that it's a live article; edits to be made on a special &quot;Edit&quot; page). Hope this helps! --[[LMS]]

(Pre-nupedia Chalkboard articles are under the copyrigth of the
authors, no the GPL, or in the Public Domain).
----
That's correct. Actually--it depends on whether the Chalkboard article appears already on Wikipedia, in which case it IS covered by the GNU license. --[[LMS]]1

Or ha-ha, only serious. You, the jury decide!

(see the [[w:Wikipedia:FAQ]], [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipetiquette]], [[w:Wikipedia:Rules to consider]], and [[w:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] for more serious thoughts.)

==Disorganize disorganization disorganizedly==
29) When in doubt, just add &quot;poop&quot; at the end of articles.

29.1) Warning: You are not logged in. Your IP address will be recorded in this page's edit history.

30) never let a sense of humour get in the way of deleting content... (&lt;font color=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;Ooh! Pink!&lt;/font&gt;) &lt;font color=&quot;#f4f4f4&quot;&gt;(and light gr&lt;/font&gt;'''''a'''''&lt;font color=&quot;#f4f4f4&quot;&gt;y&lt;/font&gt;

31) All useful information on any subject worth knowing can be condensed into a table. Just look at what Wikipedia does [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Elements|for elements]]. All items in a set can have their information standardised in a table, be they scientific elements, rock albums, novels, poems, or numbers.

[[Image:Stop_sign_us.jpg|thumb|right|Stop]]
[[Image:Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|Hammer time.]]
[[wikipedia:The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]]) The ultimate answer.  (But can you please repeat the question?)

44) Provide obvious captions on illustrations in case the reader didn't notice the picture (see example).  This goes doubly for a picture of a person in their own article.  If a portrait faces to the right it should be on the left, if it faces left it should be on the right... so if the person is looking upward, their picture goes at the bottom of the article.

45) If you feel an issue is worth discussing, be sure to discuss it in as many places as possible. Ideally, post subtly different versions of the same content to meta-Wikipedia, the mailing lists (all of them!), a range of user talk pages, at least three newly created pages, your blog, and a letter to the Times.  When carrying on a discussion with another user, make sure you post comments on the article talk page, each of your talk pages, or several of these places.  Then archive your talk page, or just blank it, leaving your half of the discussion on their talk page.  This gives others a lot of fun trying to figure out what you're responding to.  

46) Be a leader - don't listen to anyone else! duplicate material excessively (for the greatest anti-rule see rule 89)

46.141592653589) Write an article based on personal research, then use mirrors of the article on websites that use wikipedia content as your reference source.

46.46464646464646464646464646...) If an article has no citations, reference the same article. This creates a wonderful circular reference. Everyone likes those, right?

----

47) Don't bother to read what other people have written - just go in and post your own opinion, and don't worry about duplicating what's already been said - you'll have said it much better.

49) The &quot;Show preview&quot; button is a joke, don't waste your time with that: click on &quot;Save page&quot;, check your text, edit again, click on &quot;Save page&quot;, check your text, edit again, click on...  This goes doubly if you are trying to get a picture's alignment to &quot;look right&quot;, especially on every browser you have installed in your home.

&lt;math&gt;cos(&lt;math&gt;pi&lt;/math&gt;)-2&lt;/math&gt;) Use math markup even when completely unnecessary just to show off. Even better, mess it up intentionally.

-2) Duplicate material excessively. (Risk extra redundacy. Redundancy is worth the risk of being excessively over-redundant.)

-1) Numerical lists don't need to start at one or even zero, and they don't need to restrict themselves to the integers, so add whatever you like wherever you like without adjusting the numbers.  People should be thanking you for keeping them in increasing order.

1) Remember:  YOU ARE RIGHT.

2) Try to start at least one entry a day on a topic you know nothing about. Failing that, at least substantially edit the work of someone else in a subject area you are unfamiliar with.  This can both: a)allow you to learn more and 2) allow others to possibly learn less, thereby evening things out.&lt;/br&gt;

3) It is your moral responsibility to introduce [[User:Pedant|pedantic]] (Wikipedantic?) and anal-retentive irrelevancies in /Talk discussions, this allows them to increase in scope faster than resolutions and consensus can be reached

:3.a.) It is important to search for candidates for [[w:Wikipedia:Votes for deletion|votes for deletion]] mischievously, and to supply pretended authors with futile discussions and explanations. Be crude and unjustly to secure getting &quot;real&quot; wikipedians by [[w:natural selection|natural selection]].

:3.b) [[Link]] all [[en:the|the]] [[en:word|word]]s that [[en:might|might]] have an [[en:article|article]] [[en:even|even]] if [[Special:mypage|you]] don't have [[time]] to [[en:confirmation|confirm]] that it is the [[en:right|right]] meaning. [[en:If—|If]] the link becomes [[en:active|active]], it must be [[en:correct|correct]], [[en:since|since]] most words [[en:mean|mean]] only [[en:one|one]] thing, [[wikt:anyway|anyway]].

&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;) Remember to always use math markup whenever possible, especially in running text &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; like this paragraph. Nobody cares about accessibility and font sizes anyway.
* But how about math/physics/computer science articles?
**''See Rule 13, guy.''

4) It is your obligation to inform people of their inadequacies with regard to the English language, but be sure to do so in the most unhelpful way, jerk. 

4.1) Warning: You are not logged in. Your IP address will be recorded in this page's edit history.

5) As a corollary to 1) above, THE AUTHOR IS RIGHT and so you must NEVER change anything directly... long debates are acceptable on Talk: pages, but posting facts and corrections there is what the Talk: pages are all about.

:5.5) Add arbitrary horizontal rules :-)

6) There is NOOOOO... Rule 6.  Rule 7:
6) There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;!--use html instead of wikimarkup whenever it pleases you, regardless of the fact that it will eventually be changed --&gt;&lt;/i&gt; a rule number six!  This is it!

:6b) Duplicate material excessively &lt;!-- yeah, what he said --&gt;.

7)  If the morons, imbeciles and Yahoo! are making your life a misery in the :Talk section, simply start up a /Chat page instead. That'll teach them!

8)  Rule (5) does not apply if you wipe the entire page containing months of hard work and put up your own 3-sentence stub instead

9) If the original author used American spelling, do them the favour of inserting long passages in British-flavored spelling. And vice versa. (Great attraction! The greatest anti-rule is at rule 43.)

:9.0.1) If you don't know the difference between American an British spel(l?)ing, then you must im(m?)ediatel(l?)y stop editin(g?) Wikipedia. Don't touch a single comma in Wikipedia, go take a break in the dessert and Learn the Way of English dialects. When you Know, ''then'' you're ready to come back.
::9.0.1.1) For more on the British v. American spelling issue, see [[Guerilla UK spelling campaign]].

:9.1) Also, remember that [[w:England|England]], [[w:Britain|Britain]], and [[w:Madagascar|Madagascar]] are synonymous and may be used interchangeably.

:9.2) Ditto for the U.K.: [[w:Australia|Australia]] and [[w:New Zealand|New Zealand]].

:9.3) And [[w:America|America]], [[w:USA|USA]] and [[w:Canada|Canada]] is really what is usually called [[w:South America|South America]] but if you are [[w:American|American]] it really only means the 48 real States.

:9.4) And totally ignore [[ISO Country Codes]] &lt;-- see, it isn't even an article.

::9.4.1) When a comment was once true, but is now false, don't remove it, just add a brand new comment noting how the previous comment is no longer correct. [[ISO Country Codes]] IS an article now, btw.

===Over 10===
10) From number (1) above. Style it's like your own thing or way to say it and because, although some other people might disagree about these things, yet it should be ovious that the author's expressing himself is an important thing to say. Just because your teacher or somebody says you don't wright it the right way, even though it's ok to write things on Wiki articles. So don't worry about it!

11) Remember, &quot;it's&quot; is ''always'' apostrophized, and their is no difference in the slightest between &quot;their,&quot; &quot;there,&quot; and &quot;they're&quot; - only control-freak grammar [[w:Nazi|Nazi]]s complain about such stuff. Run your article through a spellchecker, and does it complain? No!

11.1) Beware of recursive rule traps introduced by new regulations.  See rule 111 for more information.

12) As a corrolary to rule (9) above, change every single page to use the spelling of your favourite variant of English &lt;i&gt;(Or Chinese ...) (Joke! It's a joke already!  Sheesh  :-) )&lt;/i&gt;, and tell authors off who use accepted spellings different from yours.

13) Ignore all attempts at serious comments on the '''anti-rules''' page. Also, duplicate material excessively.

14) Use &quot;*sigh*&quot; alot when you criticise people. this makes them pay more attention to you.
::''You forgot to capitalize the second sentence. *sigh* As always, it's up to me to teach you cretins basic English.''
:::*weeping, weeping* will you never learn?  do you even know what a gretin ''is''?
To discover the greatest anti-rule, go to rule 57.

:14.1) Use &quot;*psi*&quot; when you attack people with your psychic brain-wave super-powers.

::14.1.1) Defend your self from the &quot;*psi*&quot; attacks of other users.  Kill them with the Lance of Longinus.

:14.2) In addition to the well-placed &quot;*sigh*&quot;, rely on the tactic of feigned intellectual amusement. If you can't defeat them through reason alone, assert your superiority by deriding your opponents. (P.S.: It makes us laugh when you employ this pathetic technique.)&lt;!--pretend you are joking when you are really serious--&gt;

15) Only wimps read the backlog - write whatever you want to write, and just gamble that nobody else has written it first. And if they already have, who cares? It's not your time you're wasting.
:15.1) Add comments to polls and discussions that have long since past their expiration dates. Any discussion earlier than 2002 is in the bonus zone.&lt;!--add enough new information to make it appear that you were actually participating in ancient history--&gt;

16) If someone deletes something you wrote, immediately revert it back into existance. He'll delete it again, but if you just keep on restoring it you'll eventually convince him that your position was correct. Remember that the only way to win an argument is to make your opponent give up trying to argue with you, and sheer bull-headed refusal to yield is an excellent way to accomplish this.  If you make your first 'revert' manually, by editing the article, and then marking it as a minor edit, you can convince everyone else that your opponent violated the three-revert rule, and then get tham banned.  Consider everyone to be an opponent, not a colleague, then you can write the entire encyclopedia yourself. 

seventeen) You're on a mission to support your local tourism industry. Advertise blatantly. Use more exclamation marks. Always adress people directly (&quot;so, you can see that Cowfield is a great place to work AND play!!!&quot;). Troll in style. Ask to speedy delete or go blanking the United States Republican Party article because you voted for Kerry. Wikipedia is your blog.

18) Nonconsensually censor sententious sentences nonsensically.

18) Duplicate material excessively. After all, people should see it whichever part of the page they are browsing.
18.1) Warning: You are not logged in. Your IP address will be recorded in this page's edit history.

18) Insert lots of items under the same number. This will make it impossible to refer to them by numbers, and instead people will have to duplicate them as per above rule.
18.1) Warning: You are not logged in. Your IP address will be recorded in this page's edit history.

18) Remember that all people and races are fundamentally different. For example, 10 people waving banners in Kuala Lumpur indicates that Malaysia is a catastrophic hell-hole full of Islamic extremists. However, IRA terrorists bombing bridges and pubs in London is perfectly normal and the UK is still clearly a much safer place than those horrible places we see on TV.  Ignore the[w:Patriot act|Anti-patriot act]] American [[torture]]s and unlawful detentions multiple stolen elections and insist that the reason people hate America is that they &quot;hate our freedom&quot; and envy our system of government... ignore the fact that we put most of their dictators in power in the first place, and that we remove legitimately elected heads of state at gunpoint.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;border-style: groove; width: 150px&quot;&gt;
20) &lt;font color = blue&gt; Use font colours and formatting to &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color = red&gt; '''express your individuality!''' &lt;/font&gt;. We '''want''' to fill the Wikipdia with personal touches.
&lt;/div&gt;

19) Talk: pages were created solely as a forum for you to advance your own personal crusade. People who attempt to limit discussion to the actual article the Talk: page is attached to are narrowminded, biased, and clearly out to hurt you personally.  Additionally, odds are they are probably agents of [[Satan]] or [[w:Religious fundamentalist]]s or more likely  [[w:Nazi]]s.

20*20/20-20/0)If you're asked to help Wikipedia by deleting something or cleaning something up, don't do anything. Even better, make it worse. Help Wikipedia? What has Wikipedia ever done for YOU?!

====Under 21 need not apply====
21) Wikipedia has a professionally payed team of people whose soul porpoise in life is to copyedit.and check spelling and grammer. It is not you're repsonibilty to check your tpyography.

14-7i) Feel free to use your own complex numbering system.

 22) Use the single space indent as often as possible. People need the exercise that comes from having to use their mouse to grab the scroll bar at the bottom of the page and scroll across your fascinating commentary on whatever topic you chose to write about at that particular point in time, because after all it will be really worth it, won't it.

::''Haha - Magnus's new script means that this rule doesn't really mean anything any more... it handles the text wrapping. For people who weren't here before, text that used a single space indent would form a single line, even if it scrolled off the page forever.''

:::''That's what '''you''' think! The revenege of the single-space intenters!''

:22.1) Don't sign or timestamp your entries on talk pages. No one reads the old stuff, anyways, so no one will be confused by remarks that are no longer applicable.  This is particularly true of remarks that only read &quot;I'm with (user) on this one&quot; or &quot;we need to fix that one paragraph.&quot;

37) Don't worry about numbers too much. No one cares about maths. (For the greatest anti-rule, see rule 46) 
:''It's &quot;math&quot;, damn it! - See rule 9''
::''Ah, I just checked. I especially liked the &quot;vice versa&quot; part.''

38) Keep in mind that this is a serious project, and your own personal sense of humour will not be tolerated here. (Wikipedia has a professionally paid team of Blue Meanies whose sole purpose in life is to ensure that things are done in the One True Wikipedia Way.) See also rule 13.  (And Rule 20) (And while you're at it, rule 48920, even if it doesn't apply or exist. Though, if it doesn't exist, see whatever rule you feel like. It's not like anyone's picky about these things.)

''This rule has been deliberately left blank. Except for this message claiming blankness, which is probably a product of your imagination anyway.''

25) Remember rule 1, and throw in as much as possible of your opinion, all in the name of [[Neutral point of view]]

26) Use every possible alternate spelling of proper names and transliterated names for completeness, ensuring they will show up in a text search on any of them.  Make them all open links, and don't bother to redirect them.  Never check to see what's already an article under yet another transliteration you forgot.  Following this policy would have allowed en.wiki to have at least ten articles on the [[w:Tetragrammaton]], which would lead to much more interesting reading for all of us.  

27) Never make an open link to what should be an article, just plan on coming back later to add a single link every single time a sub-article gets written.  Certainly everyone will make time to do that critical stuff.

28) Revert articles simply for containing lots of open links - obviously if an area of knowledge or history hasn't already been well covered in Wikipedia, it must not be important. Add irrelevant sentences that disrupt the flow of an article. If attacked by a puma, fight back, pumas have attacked bicyclists due to their predatory reflex.  Particularly foreigners' history, or opposing political opinions, or anything that doesn't write for itself like a species or a dead civilization - who cares about stuff like that?

29) If you have [[Administrator on Meta|sysop]] powers, make sure to [[IP ban]] anyone that you think might be someone who may possibly have offended someone earlier - no point in letting [[w:troll]]s write articles.  [[w:The Economist]] does, and look at their audience - sheesh. And duplicate material excessively.  In particular, if you find a logged-out user editing any article tangentially related to music, it's probably Michael.  Be sure to ban the entire ISP with a ban reason of &quot;go fuck yourself michael&quot; or similiar.

30) When in doubt, click the &quot;random page&quot; link and vandalise the first article you get to.

31) Block anyone who disagrees with you, or even deletes one punctuation mark that you added (even if it was an error anyway).

34.2) If the page exists, there's an edit of it. NO EXCEPTIONS.

36) Randomly omit numbers in lists. Also, duplicate material excessively.

[[w:hexadecimal|43.8]]) This rule is kept because computers need it to function.

[[w:hexadecimal|43.C]]) This rule is kept because Wikipedia needs it for its font colors.

51) When in doubt, remove the content of the Talk: page.

52) There is far to much text on the english Wikipedia and, as you might have noticed, the server is getting slow. To help the project: 
# Pick one of the longest articles and open it for editing, 
# open any page on any other Wiki for editing in another window, 
# paste the english text to the second window (don't bother about translating it - they all speak english anyway) and, finally,
# clear the first page from all content and save your contributions in both windows.

This way the content on Wikipedia will be more balanced and you'll be celebrated as one of the most honoured contributors on a lot of Wikis.

E&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; + 1) Always make Sure to capitalize Things even when It is not Correct.

''e''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; + 2) If you include a parenthetical remark that is a complete sentence, always remember to omit final punctuation, not capitalize the first word, and include it at the end of a sentence instead of separating it off (this is a really important rule)(or even better, put the period inside the parentheses, and omit the one outside the parenthesis, and because perenteses and parenthesis are such closely-related words, use them interchangeably.) 

''e''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; + 3) Everyone who reads your article is already an expert on the subject. Therefore, it is perfectly fine to sprinkle articles with unexplained and unwikified jargon.  This is especially true when there's a need to be pedantic that only jargon can satisfy.  Thus, call a [[en:CPU]] a [[en:VLSI|VLSI]] [[en:photolithography|photolithograpichally produced]] finite-memory [[en:Turing machine|Turing machine]] quasiemulator.

32.1. Place information related to topics covered earlier in the article--such as instructions on using links--whenever you think of it. Everyone reads the entire article anyway and those paid editors will come around and organize it eventually.

:55.1 As a corollary, put as much of every opposing viewpoint as possible in the first sentences of an article. People are more interested in the different sides of the argument about the topic, than they are in the subject, anyway. This also helps to create redundancies by duplicating material excessively.

That way, u can duplicate material excessively. That way it looks much more intellectual, and of course, its always elegant to use foreign words. Of course, do that in a Language version of wikipedia of a language ur not very good at, neither in grammar nor in spelling. In best case, its not your Mother´s Tongue. Mix up with grammar rules and words of your actual Muttersprache. ignore that the bad translator´s version of the part of the article doesn´t make sense, even if the language it translated to is your native language. formulate your sentences as complex as possible, using your native languages grammar in a FOREIGN language. make spellig mistakes on PURPOSE, and write randomly IN Caps. Also, don´t care if you fucked up the numeration AGAIN. its not your problem. There are People assigned only to remove your mistakes, of which you know, that you make them. If youre asked about it, lie, claim it´s not your fault because you are not good at the language. if someone points out that you in that case should not edit an article in that language, ignore him. its your freedom of expression or something to do that. 4nd rem€m8er: 1337 1mpre$$e$ ch1&lt;ks

97.000000001. Always create rules with decimles. And misspells desimels

98.  What did we say about duplicating too much overly redundant information?  It's at the top opf the page, and in many other places, but for redundancy's sake, it is reproduced here.  Always at every opportunity excessively and unnecessartily duplicate redundantly and redundant information, preferably that which has already been excessively over-redundantly and unnecessarily multi-replicated and duplicated elsewhere, including or otherwise the intended unnecessary site for the redundant excessive redundant duplication, excessively.

104) Full sentences.

105. Consistent subheadings. And correct. Formulas in headings. TOC proofread.

''Haha - Magnus' neues Skript hat dazu geführt, dass diese Regel sinnlos geworden ist ... Es managt die Zeilenumbrüche. Für Leute, die bis jetzt noch nicht hier waren: Text, der die Ein-Leerzeichen-Einrückung benutzt hat, blieb in einer Zeile, auch wenn es weit aus der sichtbaren Seite herausragte.''

:Das ist was '''du''' denkst! Fürchte die Rache der Ein-Leerzeichen-Einrückungs-Benutzer!

23&gt; Ganze Sätze.

37) Laß die Sorgen über Zahlen. Niemand schert sich um Mathe.

:''Ah, jetzt hab ich's gelesen. Ich mag besonders den &quot;und umgekehrt&quot;-Teil.''

38) Beachte: Es handelt sich hier um ein seriöses Projekt, und dein persönlicher Sinn für Humor wird nicht toleriert werden. (Wikipedia hat ein professionelles Team von Fieslingen, deren einziger Daseinszweck ist, sicher zu stellen, dass die Dinge in der Einzig Wahren Wikipediaweise getan werden.) Siehe auch Regel 13.  (Und Regel 20) (und überhaupt)

23) [[A pome of sorts in narrative style...|Passende Links]]?

23.1) Soviel zum letzten Absatz von Regel -1 ...

24) Sei so frei, solche Quellen wie geheime mittelalterliche Ritterregeln, seltsame religiöse Offenbarungen oder unter Verschluss gehaltene Dokumente von ultrageheimen Spionageagenturen zu benutzen, ohne eine irgendwie geartete Dokumentation oder Referenz, um deine Jagdgründe zu sichern. Hey, warum sollte dir nicht jedermann glauben, was du so sagst?  (Siehe auch Regeln Nummer 1 und 19).

26) Editiere sparsam. Oft kann man durch das Einfügen das kleinen aber nützlichen Wortes &quot;nicht&quot; an der richtigen Position den angestrebten Effekt sehr effektiv erreichen. Kleinere Änderungen wie diese sollen nicht immer als solche markiert werden, wenn du speicherst.

Überprüfe nie, was in einem Artikel mit einer alternativen Schreibweise steht, die du vergessen hast.

27) Mache nie aus einem offenen Link einen Artikel, sondern nimm dir vor, später zurückzukehren und einen einzelnen Link einzufügen, jedesmal, wenn ein Unterartikel geschrieben wird. Gewiss wird jedermann sich die Zeit nehmen, dieses wichtige Zeug zu erledigen.

28) Mache Artikelbearbeitungen wegen der vielen enthaltenen offenen Links rückgängig - wenn ein Wissensgebiet bisher offensichtlich nicht sehr gut in Wikipedia vertreten ist, dann muss es unwichtig sein. Und lösche unwichtige Sätze, die den Artikelfluss unterbrechen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This page was previously called &quot;An impending scalability problem&quot;, dates from late [[2001]] and is an early example of the concern for reviewing edits to articles. It is retained as part of the history of the project.''

Monday, August 13, 2001, 11:04 AM -- After the Slashdotting of my [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/25/103136/121 Kuro5hin article], Wikipedia has enjoyed a huge influx of new writers who, like the old ones, are mainly doing a good job, writing reasonably good articles, avoiding topics of which they're mostly ignorant, and generally keeping each other honest. But the influx of all these solid, and very welcome, hands has raised a scalability problem in some people's minds--and the problem is, arguably, already here, or will be with the next major influx of Wikipedia people. It is perhaps not immediately obvious that it is even a problem at all--and perhaps we ought to conclude, after further consideration, that it will never really be a serious problem. But let's take a look, anyway.

The problem, or alleged problem, is difficult to state precisely; generally and vaguely, it is that it is increasingly difficult for &quot;us&quot; to monitor all the activity that's going on. This makes it all too easy for bad edits to creep in and pass quickly down the [[Recent Changes]] uncaught.

To clarify the problem, it's best to work with an example. Suppose we doing screaming business on Wikipedia, with the number of edits, according to the [[Recent Changes]] page, clocking it at an average 100 per hour. Suppose I write an article about [[epistemic circularity]]--a recherche topic in philosophy. Then, two months later, a philosophy student makes a bunch of really bad edits to the article--rendering it a morass of misinformation, worse than no article at all. Being an expert on epistemic circularity, I would be able to see that they're bad edits, but hardly anyone else could see that--if they're paying attention at all, which they probably aren't. Due to the rate of edits on [[Recent Changes]], though, and maybe I'm spending time in Russia or Ireland (who knows?), I overlook the edit, and the bad edits remain.

Multiply this situation somehow--considering, anyway, the ''many'' recherche topics there are in the existence--and the fact that edits are going by so fast that no one can catch all the problems, and we have a problem of creeping poor quality, not because we're incapable of dealing with each instance of poor quality by itself, but because we're incapable of dealing with ''all'' the instances.

There's an obvious reply to this, which I commend to you. If the number of edits increases, then so does the number of people ''looking'' at the edits. So where's the problem? Sure, mistakes get through--that's always been the case. How would increasing the rate of production increase the proportion of mistakes made? Sure, it increases the ''number'' of mistakes, but not (necessarily, anyway) the ''proportion.''

This is an excellent point, and we must bear it in mind when we think about the scalability of Wikipedia: increased activity implies both increased productivity and increased ''amounts'' of bad work, but that ''by itself'' doesn't imply that there will be increased ''proportions'' of bad work.

Radically increased production ''does'' mean that it's impossible for any ''one person'' to monitor all the activity on Wikipedia. But what need is there for any one person to monitor all the activity on Wikipedia?

So if we're going to find and solve a scalability problem, we've got to identify it precisely. A more easily-delineated problem is aesthetic and ergonomic: suppose I'm interested in a few select topics in philosophy, music, literature, and geography, and I really don't care what people are writing about chemistry, gardening, art history, and sports. On the [[Recent Changes]] page, I have to scan the whole blasted thing--which, as we all know, is (delightfully enough) getting longer and longer on average as the months go by--in order to find edits that are relevant to my interests. It seems it would increase my productivity if I were able to identify topics somehow by general category. Of course, this raises a can of worms; but I think we can all agree that it would be at least somewhat useful, and some people might find it extremely useful.

So I'd like to put this question to you: am I somehow not understanding what scalability problems are lurking about here? Or am I right to suspect that greater amounts of activity will not mean any problems for quality? If not, please identify, ''precisely,'' what the problem is, please.

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
It would, of course, help the ''scanning the Recent Changes'' page if people would (a) admit to themselves when a change is a minor edit and (b)write a summary note giving some idea about what they've just done. I am guilty of breaking both of those (the first by carelessness more often than not), but it would help.

--MichaelTinkler
----
Yes, some means of officially &quot;registering&quot; with the software that I want to montior certain pages or groups of pages might be useful. I also agree that the &quot;minor edit&quot; box is useful--but I see it abused in both directions: people check the &quot;minor edit&quot; box after they have made an actual content change, thereby &quot;hiding&quot; their change from view. It would be good to get into the habit of change summaries--I am guilty of not doing that. It is possible that the problem will be solved by community standards, but I think some software changes will be needed as well. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]
: Yep, I think this is a good idea, too, and I think it's a good idea to fill out that &quot;summary&quot; line--I do pretty often but not as often as I should. --LMS
----
It seems to me that adding a box to &quot;notify of changes to this article,&quot; followed by an automatic email when the page is changed, would be simpler to implement than some sort of metadata system--but I might be wrong, as I have been many times before; and just because it ''might'' be simpler does not mean that it will be simple at all. And so I'm not sure if that would be the correct approach either.

And I'll admit to abusing the &quot;minor edit&quot; box myself; I check it now by habit and have unintentionally &quot;hidden&quot; many new entries that way, which then do not show up on &quot;new topics,&quot; among other things. --KQ
----
I agree with LDC and KQ, there should be a list basically identical to [[Recent Changes]], but only topics that you subscribe to are listed there, that would the most effective in my opinion. Also some education is needed in exactely when you need to check the &quot;This change is a minor edit&quot; box. I read the articles on how to edit a page and the FAQ, but didn't see it explained, IIRC. --[[Creaktop]]
-----
oh, hell! I could have avoided the whole 'baroque' debate if I'd just deleted the 'intricate detail' and called it a minor edit!
NOW I know!

The only thing I think I systematically elide with 'minor edit' is new revisions to the &quot;biographical listings&quot; page.
--MichaelTinkler
----
1. A &quot;personalised&quot; [[Recent Changes]] page showing only changes in articles you subscribed to.
2. Email notification of changes to articles you subscribed to; can be done with or without the actual diff in email.

Both of these require maintaining a list of subscribed articles in one's Preferences
which, however, is not that big a deal and can be implemented in the same script with a new action &quot;editsubscr&quot;, to which there would be a big shiny link on the &quot;editprefs&quot; page.

3. The same as in 1. or 2. but done not to subscribed articles but rather to any articles containing a keyword or keyphrase you registeres as your interest.

This is more CPU-intensive, but still doable. It might be an overkill; heck, even 1. or 2. might be overkills, but I'm just trying to lay out the possibilities.

4. Saving with &quot;minor edit&quot; set may trigger a warning if more than 10 lines are detected as changed in the article, or if the article is new.

What do y'all think? -- [[AV]]

P.S. I volunteer to help with the actual programming, should help be needed.
: This all sounds great, but perhaps there are other similar ideas we should consider as well? See below for another idea. I don't know which is best. I do like the article subscription idea, but I think that doesn't do the same thing that would be done by allowing people to select categories into which edits can be placed. See below... --LMS
----
Something that might be desirable is a &quot;review&quot; system, where users who review a particular change can register their approval or disapproval of a particular change, and have the review status appear in the recent changes display. So you can see what has and hasn't had at least some level of review.--[[Belltower]]
: As any seasoned Wikipedian knows, the simple ability to ''change'' what problems any potential reviewers would spot ''constitutes'' a sort of review. See [[/Peer review and the Wikipedia process]] for elaboration. --LMS
: Yes, but the original point is that no one may review a particular article. There's no way to register that I *like* a particular revision. Meanwhile, reviewing every change to every article I have some knowledge of is time-consuming and I'm liable to miss a few -- isn't that the crux of the problem? If recent changes also listed a &quot;rating&quot;, say a 1.0-5.0 value with a number of votes, then I can see at a glance what hasn't had much review. I've also avoided doing one change because someone explicitly changed it (U-boat to U-boot), and while I could change it, they can just change it back again, and I could see potential Wiki &quot;wars&quot; in the future. If a change got a low rating, that might discourage the person from changing it to the less desired version. --[[Belltower]]
----
And now when the scalability issue emerges, recall the subject I raised some time
ago about metadata, categories, changes to the software.&lt;br&gt;
All of my opinions were either rejected outright, played down or it was said
&quot;too early for that&quot; or &quot;rules are a bad thing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
It's a pity that we should have known better.&lt;br&gt;
Discussion and changes are needed soon before Wikipedia collapses under her
own weight and turn our pet project into a laugh project.&lt;br&gt;
Save our souls.&lt;br&gt;--[[Kpjas]]
:You seem to be ignoring the content of my essay, [[Kpjas]]. :-) In the essay, I am not supporting your view; I am taking the skeptical position that there ''isn't'' a scalability problem as far as ''quality of content'' goes. Do you care to give an ''argument'' that there is one? I haven't seen one yet. Everyone seems to assume that there is one. There is one as far as ''ease of use'' goes--so that I could easily check changes to all philosophy articles, for instance--I'll agree with that. (Although I don't think that's a very serious problem yet.) Also, it is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the case that all of your ideas were played down or rejected--give me break. After all, plenty of your ideas have been rather common ideas. --LMS, slightly exasperated
----
I think the crux of the scalability problem is that there's currently no way to scale the editorial process (informal as it is) because there's no method for collaboration.
::Could you elaborate, please? I'm not sure what you mean here. I mean, of course there's a method for collaboration--the wiki format is brilliant at it. --LMS

:::Well sometimes brevity is the soul of confusion, not wit. I guess I wasn't clear. The wiki format is brilliant a some kinds of collaboration. My claim is just that &lt;i&gt;editorial process&lt;/i&gt; is not one of those things. It would be better if there were clear ways for a group to collaborate &lt;i&gt;as editors.&lt;/I&gt;

:::Some of this would require software changes. For example there ought to be a way to mark pages so a group or individual can tell if they've been looked at. Preferably there would be multiple kinds of marks so a page could be marked [[wikified]], [[peer validated]], [[typographical errors]], [[work needed]], or even [[bad]]. . I also think it's important to have a way to break down the recent changes page so that several people together could look at every new page today, or this week, or whatever.

:::Other changes likely will not require software updates. We could create the above pages, and collaborate to update them with links to the pages that need specific kinds of work. Teams of people could be formed to work on each of those pages. I'm not sure if it's possible to search for every page which does not contain a link to [[wikified]], but if it is, we could just add the above links to pages search on the pages which do not contain those links, and use that as a starting point for update work. --[[Mark Christensen]]

It would be nice to break up the recent changes into manageable chunks and get an informal group together to work together to look at all the changes, but there's no good way to do this. I think this is just as necessary as a simplified way to keep track of articles in your field. -- [[Mark Christensen]]

:I think this is a sensible suggestion. One idea is for us to decide on some set of &quot;top level categories,&quot; make a drop-down box, which must select an area whenever an edit is made; the default area is whatever the last &quot;editor&quot; selected. This would be for the ease of sorting the [[Recent Changes]] page--not metadata about the article. Jimbo has talked about doing this for months. I think that if someone were to present some clean code that does this (this=a set of more specific requirements I could provide you with on request :-) ) to Jimbo and to CliffordAdams (it sounds to me like it would be rather easy...), they could upload the code--without uploading the page name crunch-inducing latest version of the software. --LMS

It just occurred to me that it'd be nice to have the
[[Recent Changes]] remember what I've seen already, and perhaps
put horizontal rules at each point in the list where I've
visited the page. -J

:Look at the hint I put on my personal page ([[hornlo]]) yesterday; this sort of gives you what you want -- just drag the '''List new changes starting from''' link from the [[Recent Changes]] page to your desktop or quick link toolbar each time you leave or close the RC page -- that gives you one-click-away access to just those changes made since you last looked at RC. --[[loh]]

----
Delete me anyone if I repeat a known idea (this page is too long to read it all). I would like to see &quot;My Recent Changes&quot; with the list of changes made to articles I have edited, sorted by the date of changes made by others with an option &quot;Skip this article now and for ever&quot;. This way I could follow the trail of destruction, e.g. Larry's &lt;i&gt;coup de grace&lt;/i&gt; on the &quot;theory&quot; of the role of sleep for learning :) -- [[Piotr Wozniak]]
----
I have implemented something on my underpopulated usemod wiki [http://www.projectmosaic.org] that I think will satisfy many people. It is a recent changes page that only reports changes to pages that are linked to from a given page. So, for example, you can go to http://www.projectmosaic.org/wiki.pl?action=rc&amp;amp;page=ChronicFatigueSyndrome&amp;amp;days=90 and find recent changes for only those pages linked to from http://www.projectmosaic.org/wiki.pl?ChronicFatigueSyndrome. Or, Piotr, you could maintain a list of pages you want to review at [[Piotr Wozniak/Watch List]], then click on Recent Changes for that page, and see all recent changes to those pages alone. --DanKeshet
-----
This sounds like an excellent idea. I'd definitely use it to keep an eye on articles that interest me. I also think that the idea above of some type of categorization could be useful, but at the same time it would be constricting if it was only possible to give each page one categorization. --[[Pinkunicorn]]

-----
There are at least two ways of categorising, it seems to me.
One is to attach the categories with an article (like the see also: links)
The other is to make pages for each of the categories and then link the articles to that page.
Granted, this method may turn into a page o' links, but that would be the point.

To manage either method, being able to save the pages found by searching for a word phrase as a 'category' page would be useful. As would the ability to 'merge' two such pages...

Being able to make a 'recent changes' type page for a given page o' links would be useful too. (is that what DanKeshet was offering ?) If you could build one based on 2 links away or n links away, then you could have pages of categories of categories etc.

-----

I don't think there will be a quality issue with more editors. The key is that over time articles will be shaped by many hands, resulting in an optimal balance of being mostly satisfactory for most people, while being truly objectionable to very few people, if anyone. There will be short-term fluctuations in quality, but the long-term trend will be a smooth curve towards improvement. How long 'over time' lasts will depend on the obscurity of topic. Larry's example of epistemic circularity might indeed be a morass for many months, until a qualified person finally shows up to fix it. An inappropriate edit to the Ku Klux Klan page will likely be fixed in less than an hour. It will take longer for an obscure topic to be improved, but if we measure in terms of page views rather than days, it will be about equal.

I had an idea about the other issue - filtering out certain topics of interest. Perhaps every page in Wikipedia could be embedded with a drop down menu that lists major topics. When someone chooses a topic, a javascript app shows a list of subtopics. So if you choose biology - botany, zoology, evolution, etc. appear in the new list. An reader can pick the relevent topic and subtopic, and pages will be categorized piecemeal be users. Then these topics could be used as the basis of creating a tree structure for the encyclopedia, as well as for the filtered recent changes pages.

[[TimShell|TS]]

Thank you for the column, Larry.

Here is what I need:

#The ability to subscribe to an existing page.
#Recent Changes showing (on request) only:
**pages I have subscribed to that have been edited in the past ''n'' days, or
**pages created in the past ''n'' days.

That would let me monitor a limited set of pages that I decide to contribute to in a major way. Being presented with new pages as well would allow me to add to my pageset those that I find relevant.

---
One thing people should note is that some browsers (Mozilla and Internet Explorer, I believe) have settings for automagically notifying you that a page has changed. So people might want to look into that as a monitoring method.--[[Belltower]]

:Another option is the free [http://mindit.netmind.com/ Mind-it] service. It's my &quot;monitoring method&quot; of choice for any page on the Web. ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[tbc]]''
----
I just have one little caveat: I hope I didn't give anyone the impression that I think there is ''no'' scalability problem. Mainly, I wrote the above to get people thinking about what the scalability problem(s) is (are).

I think there are pretty obviously four scalability problems we ''will'' have to deal with:

# For the sake of aesthetics and ergonomics, we should change the [[Recent Changes]] page so that it is possible to view changes that are only in certain categories. I like the idea of allowing people to multi-select categories in which their changes will appear. This categorizes changes without categorizing whole articles, which is something we should avoid, I think. (Actually, I'd like to hear some ''good arguments'' that we should have some hard-wired category scheme, and even wrote a [[/Columns|column]] on this subject, but I haven't seen any yet. I mean, I love category schemes myself, but I don't like hard-wiring them.)
# Edit lock problems might increase if traffic increases radically (I have no idea what to do about this--right now there's a once-per-five-minute cron job that's done, but I still encounter edit locks myself).
# The search feature has become essentially useless (I virtually never use it, because it takes forever), and if I'm not mistaken, it's a burden on the server as well. This obviously hasn't scaled well, and we'll be working on a solution to this soon.
# My understanding is that UseModWiki saves articles in text format, and past a certain point, this is unworkable. So eventually we're almost certainly going to have to make Wikipedia database-driven. Again, this is something we ''might'' be doing soon.

--[[LMS]]

Seems to me that making the source and data available as tarballs is a step
in the right direction, towards a distributed web presence. Supporting
various functions (browsing, searching) can be done with sufficiently
up-to-date mirrors.

Imagine a simple mirror scheme, with one primary mirror being the definitive
source of an article (the current www.wikipedia.com). Secondary mirrors
would fetch [[Recent Changes]] and associated diffs on some regular basis and
apply them to the local copy.

A client would begin a session by browsing a secondary mirror. Secondary
mirrors could reasonably take on the bulk of the burden of serving most
searches and browsing requests. When a request for an edit page comes into
a secondary mirror, it gets redirected to the primary. That way, the text
entry box will contain the latest text, minimizing conflicts.

This might require [[Recent Changes]], or a derivative thereof under a new name,
to take a timestamp argument and to return diffs relative only to that
timestamp.

This assumes that the ratio of read-only hits to editpage hits is high
enough for the offloading to pay off.

The other advantage of this doesn't have as much to do with scalability as
it does to the maintainence of geographically (and politically) diverse,
living archives (ie, a separate copy of the Wikipedia content is more likely
to be kept up to date and in good working, accessible order if it is
actively being used by some invested population of users).

Response to rule 9):
:I'll break the ice in replying to these to suggest that there ''is'' at least one good reason for changing an article from British English to American or vice versa: if you, a writer of one dialect, add paragraphs or otherwise substantially change the content of an article in the other dilect, and don't feel competent to copyedit your own changes in the other dialect, by all means just copyedit the whole article in yours, regardless of where it started. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

LDC: Surely editing British English isn't that hard? I can easily write either. (Though in practice I'm lazy so I write a mishmash, using British spellings one moment and American spellings the next...) -- [[Simon J Kissane]]

:I'm probably far more qualified than most Americans; I wrote most of the article here on British/American differences.  But no, I don't consider myself qualified to copyedit British text, so I wouldn't consider 95% of Americans (and probably 80% of Brits :-) qualified to do so.  It's a far more complex issue than making sure you spell &quot;colour&quot; and &quot;specialise&quot; differently, and even grammar like &quot;the team are...&quot;; there are also matters of usage that are not covered in that article.  Also all texts are understood in the context of a culture, and even those of us who have mastered the spelling and grammar differences can't be sure that the words we use have the same cultural connotations.  Often that doesn't matter, but when you're writing, say, about politics or culture itself, it matters a lot. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]


First of all let '''Cunctuator''' sell a Cunctipedia when enough HD space exists on the PC-unctuator. Second, it does grow weary to try so hard to propose that a new paradigm in an article exists(see [[New_Age]] revison history), then find all these &quot;science guys&quot; slamming the book of rules(the 500 yr old scientific progress report) down. Third, where the hell is Kuala Lampur and why doesn't he &lt;b&gt;feed&lt;/b&gt; them Koalas instead of making them wait around while he over-edits anything he wants ? &quot;The Mate with a grate&quot; eh ?--BF

:BF - I'd gladly respond to this if I even vaguely understood what your complaint was. Kuala Lumpur is the capital city of Malaysia. 

You're not supposed to be proposing new things.  You're ''supposed'' to be reporting on existing things in an unbiased manner.  If you are interested in doing something different, do it elsewhere!

Ok and if we  all were unbiased you who are such experts in wikipediatrics would either be at peace or more boring than you already are. Thanks Manning for that nice lecture in newage/talk. I am learning =)

:wrong - I never said '''I am unbiased'''. Hell, I have some very some very strong beliefs. But I endeavour at all costs to ensure I don't report them as &quot;the truth&quot; in the Wikipedia. It's an issue of giving fair consideration to all. - MB


&lt;br&gt;Manning is biased against bias.
:You got a problem with that??? Meet me outside!

A comment on the &quot;anti-rules&quot; page at present: this page is a disgrace.  I wish you would all agree to delete it.  It just causes more ill-will, and the joke has run very thin. --[[LMS]]

:Larry - with all due respect, could you substantiate your claim that this page causes &quot;ill-will&quot;? I acknowledge that you have opposed it from day one (as is your right), but I find it quite funny myself, and I suspect I am not alone. However, if it is really upsetting the majority of people then by all means delete it. I'm just not convinced that that is the case. - MB

LMS, you are, generally speaking, the most biased person i have encountered on the Wikipedia and the most insistent about imposing your biases on others. It seems to me that you are hypersensitive to any criticism of yourself, your opiions, or Wikipedia. I'm sure your motives are of the best but I really think you need a serious re-examination of your values on this.

:That's what he's paid for. Without someone &quot;imposing values&quot; on the project, it will just degrade into Everything2. The primary value we want to impose is to direct our efforts into producing a useful product: an encyclopedia, with good information, well written, easy to use, and easy to update. I happen to think a little vigorous debate and black humor along the way is a good thing too; Larry apparently is less enthusiastic about those things. But I don't for a moment argue with the need for Larry to enforce a sense of direction on the project.  Without that, we won't have an actual product.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

:Yeah, what LDC said :) - MB

:Agreed. But I like this page. Lighten up, Larry. :) --[[STG]]

This page encourages us to treat each other with contempt and hostility, when we should be working ''together'' on this project, in a spirit of friendly collaboration.  I really don't think you people get it.  Not all humor is constructive.  I do think we should delete this page.  It sucks and it is completely unfunny. --[[LMS]]

:No, Larry, it encourages us to remember that though we might disagree about many things on Wikipedia, we should keep things in perspective and not take our squabbles as deadly serious. Many Wikipedians do see this page as increasing the spirit of friendly collaboration that we like in Wikipedia.  

::Right, we shouldn't take our squabbles as deadly serious.  The page decidedly doesn't increase the spirit of friendly collaboration, though.  It constitutes a way for people to humiliate other people at work on the project in good faith.

:This is humor, Larry, the &quot;contempt and hostility&quot; are &lt;i&gt;joke&lt;/i&gt; &quot;contempt and hostility&quot;, a reminder not to fall into &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; contempt and hostility on these bases. 

::There are others who might very well take it differently.  I certainly do.  Because you, if you were to write one of the items here, wouldn't ''intend'' contempt and hostility, that doesn't mean that that'd be an illegitimate interpretation.

:Monty Python used to have a &quot;pantomime Princess Margaret&quot;. Nobody mistook her for the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Princess Margaret. We would have to wonder about anyone who did.

::You are missing the point. --[[LMS]]

Methinks the Larry doth protest too much - [[clasqm]]

::I guess I'll have to wait for the next round to find out what that's supposed to mean.  :-) --LMS

:Larry, if you don't like the damn page, stop checking up on it!
:Other people like it. Is anyone else complaining to you about it?

Why do you care what I think about it?  :-)  Maybe I'm flogging a dead horse here, but I really care about the point I'm making.  I'm stressing the point because I hate what the page represents: the wrong attitude toward the social atmosphere of Wikipedia.  The page can be very easily and justifiably regarded as unfriendly, unwelcoming, and hostile to newcomers.  You might not see it that way, but it can be perfectly justifiably taken that way.

To take the first example that fell to hand, someone wrote:

:20) Use font colours and formatting to express your individuality! . We want to fill the Wikipdia with personal touches.

::''Hey - that someone was me!!!! - [[MMGB]]''
There are new members who might, seeing this and seeing that they are the butt of a joke, will understand that there are other people lurking about--maybe everyone on Wikipedia, for all they can guess--who get a low sort of pleasure from making fun of, rather than gently and diplomatically correcting, the bad habits of others.  I guess that many of you who are defending this page don't really realize this, or care.

Don't worry; I won't delete it myself.  That's really all I want to say.  Now, keep flaming away.  :-) --[[LMS]]
:It's not that we don't &quot;realize&quot; your point, it's that we don't agree with you. I think that everyone recognizes this as a good-spirited spoof. Except you, of course. ;-) --[[STG]]

----

Good lord, I think we might be taking tentative steps toward a consensus on this page. We must be eating too much tofu or something.  :-)

:I know. This is probably the strongest community consensus in all of Wikipedia. Too bad Larry isn't in on it. :) --[[STG]]

&lt;font color=&quot;magenta&quot; face=Verdana,Serif&gt;Hey !! Think&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Pink&lt;/b&gt; ~BF&lt;/font&gt;
----
Hey, BF, about rule number twenty:

''20) Use font colours and formatting to express your individuality! . We want to fill the Wikipdia with personal touches.''

Since it was inspired by you, let me ask you this: do you consider this to be a &lt;font color=red&gt;mean spirted dig&lt;/font&gt;, or &lt;font color=pink&gt;good-natured teasing&lt;/font&gt;? (Or something entirely different, perhaps? I don't want to ask a leading question here.) --[[STG]]

: As the offender who created this rule, [[BF]] and I get along just fine - I assume she took it as a joke (I hope so, anyway). If she was offended I'm sure she would have said something. - [[MMGB]]

----

You know, I still find this page '''really''' funny. Especially rule 0, hey - Cunc said to delete whenever you felt like it! (Who did that btw?). - [[MMGB]]

:This one is actually even funnier than you think. It was originally just: &quot;0) The Cunctator's Anti-Rule: Delete or overwrite that which annoys you in any way.&quot; and I &lt;i&gt;added&lt;/i&gt; &quot;Especially the parts about&quot;. There never &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; any more of the second sentence and no part of it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; deleted!

:Unfortunately, when I see how funny everybody thinks it is I start to wonder if Larry's take on this is right. (Larry, that's &quot;start to wonder&quot;, not a whole-hearted move to your camp. No offense. :-) )

----
I haven't laughed this hard in weeks. Just discovered this article. Took away all the tension from thinking about having to deal with articles in which people obeyed these rules verbatim.  Thanks for having this here!  Made my day.  Of course, reading this talk page brought me back down to earth again... I'm thinking I might have to delete all of it so it doesn't give anyone else a downer in the future, and as a new admin, I want all newbies to know that this is exactly the sort of critical decision and action that all admins take on a regular basis.  [[User:Elf|Elf]] 15:45, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

[[Wikipedia Anti-rules|This page]] had me in tears (LOL). Just the ticket for wikistress. [[User:Gracefool|··gracefool]] 14:25, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Just read the latest additions about ALL CAPS TAKING UP LESS SPACE and &quot;Bad bad bad bad bad bad excessive redundant duplicate redundancy&quot; and just about turned myself inside out laughing.  You guys are just way too good at this! [[User:Elf|Elf]] 04:09, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC) again.

Not to rain on anyone's party, but during my entire editing career, every time the &quot;Edit Conflict&quot; screen showed itself, I always thought Rule 102 was genuine standard practice.  I rarely incorporate changes from edit conflicts, and the chance of me just replacing it wholesale with my text increases the more times the EC happens in succession. [[w:User:Chriscf]]

---
Spent the lastt few hours trying to cut out six paragraphs in an article that repeated itself in each, with different terminology, due to what looked like weeks of edit wars and reverting- all in the worst english of any kind I've seen in a long while. This saved my brain from imploding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">August 28, 12:10 AM -- I will have to flesh this out later, but I felt compelled to outline, for now, a number of basic standards for excellent articles in general:

* They begin with a definition or clear description of the subject at hand.  This is made as absolutely clear to the nonspecialist as the subject matter itself will allow.  The purpose of an encyclopedia is to codify human knowledge in a way that is most accessible to the most people, and this demands clear descriptions of what the subject matter is about.  So we aren't just dropped into the middle of the subject from the first word--we are eased into it.
* They acknowledge and explore, in depth, the different ways there are of approaching the same topic.  They are not intellectually provincial or academically imperialistic (often, two sides of the same coin).  They do not reflect just one person's point of view--they are evidently the result of many people collaborating, or one person really thinking hard and ''really'' understanding very well all the different ways there are to come to grips with the subject.
* They are completely [[neutral point of view|unbiased]].  They make a careful attempt, as is sometimes possible only in the hands of a true expert, to present each of various competing views on controversial subjects fairly and sympathetically.  Not only are the competing views sympathetically presented, they are ''organized logically,'' so that the author has a clear understanding of the &quot;lay of the land.&quot;  Of course, the most popular views, whatever they are, are emphasized, and the extreme minority views are underemphasized (though they might be highly detailed on their own pages).
* They are long.  Almost every article, when it is ''really'' excellent, is going to have to be quite long in order to be any good.
* They reflect ''expert'' knowledge of a sort that is careful and precise.  While they are clear and accessible, they are not full of the sorts of vague generalities and half-truths that almost inevitably crop up when nonexperts try to write articles on stuff that they only think they understand.
* They are well-documented.  They have references.  The references are not idiosyncratic to the author but are the references that are most often used in the field.
* They are really ''clearly'' written.  They are written in such a way that it's difficult to misunderstand what is meant.  Not only do they begin with a definition, they follow a self-evident structure and use clearly-worded sentences.  They are written throughout with attention to how ''someone who actually needs the article'' will understand, or might potentially fail to understand, what is said.
* Their structure, and the necessity of each of the parts of the article, are either self-evident or carefully explained.  For example, a reader should not encounter a section of the article and ''not'' know the answer to the question, &quot;Why is this section of the article here at all?&quot;
* They do not leave essential terminology unexplained, even within the article itself.  If some piece of terminology is ''essential'' to the subject itself, then it should be explained in the article about that subject, even if it is ''also'' explained on another page as well.  The reader should not have to visit other pages to view essential parts of the exposition of a subject (unless the article is very obviously mainly just a high-level introductory page that points to other articles).
* They are written in an engaging manner.  They do not use long, convoluted sentences and otherwise needlessly boring language.
* They contain all the same basic sorts of information that other articles of the same kind(s) contain.  All biographies, for example should contain birth and death dates, if known.  Of course, Wikipedia is a long way off from having this sort of consistency and completeness right now.

That's all I could think of for right now.  :-)

By the way, by no means do I think that anyone should try very hard to meet all of these various standards.  Such perfectionism will just slow us down.  I think it's very important that we add as much imperfect work to Wikipedia as possible.  But I also think it can't hurt to keep in the back of our minds the various ways that this imperfect work can be improved. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Friday, August 31, 2001, 4:02 PM -- 
As part of my extracurricular activities, I play Irish fiddle.  I
suggested on Irtrad-L, a music mailing list, that somebody set up a wiki
devoted to listing Irish traditional music sessions.  (Nobody is
maintaining a complete, definitive list these days, and I thought a wiki
would be the perfect solution.)  I gave Wikipedia as an example of a wiki
so people could understand what wikis are all about.

Well, wouldn't you know it but somebody decides to start the list ''on
Wikipedia.''  At first I said (on Irtrad-L) that this was a bad idea, for a
variety of reasons--that the wiki should be located somewhere else.  Then
I thought again: hey, we can always ''copy'' the information that gets
started on Wikipedia to wherever the information will eventually live.  So
why not let people get ''started,'' working on Wikipedia?

''Then'' the thought occurs to me that the net result of this will be a few
more cheerfully addicted Wikipedians--particularly if there is indeed a
successful Irish session wiki started up, they will learn the wiki system
and remember that Wikipedia is what got them into it originally.  Warm
fuzzies!

It occurs to me now that this is actually probably a very good way to get
people into Wikipedia who might otherwise not know or care at all about
it.  We all have hobbies and academic interests that, in various ways,
might be very well-served by the collaborative treatment that wikis allow.
So that's my thought--we could start encouraging the creation of wikis
about our interests, and offer to host an initial page about it, and then
encourage people to take the wiki info elsewhere.

(Unless it's actually encyclopedic info--in which case, encourage them to
keep it on Wikipedia.  :-) )

Someone's already done this, too, with AmbientCalculiOnline.  That
actually brings Wikipedia quite a few hits.

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
I think it's great to attach collaborative sites to wikipedia articles like AmbientCalculiOnline does. The only concern would be that the material on those pages could be mistaken for encyclopedic and neutral because of the wikipedia URL. How about if we ask people to stick to certain page names, for example &quot;External: Irish music&quot; or maybe &quot;Non-Wikipedia: Irish music&quot; or &quot;Group discussion: Irish music&quot;?
--AxelBoldt
----
My proposal entails that, with few exceptions like AmbientCalculiOnline (which occupies one page that will never be an encyclopedia article), we encourage people to ''begin'' projects here, and ''then'' (quickly) move them elsewhere.  This makes your suggestion unnecessary. --[[LMS]]
----
I think this isn't a very good idea.  It stands a risk of just increasing the amount of useless cruft in the database, and incurring name collisions.  UseModWiki is extremely easy to set up, and those wishing to use wiki should do so.  If they happen to produce information that can be used in wiki, then it'd just be a matter of cut and paste to bring appropriate bits of it back in.
----
I don't like it either. Here are some potential problems that I see:
# '''Confusion of content:''' How will people know the difference between encyclopedia content and the content of special projects?
# '''Name collisions:''' Projects will use pages that should be reserved for articles.
# '''Abandoned projects:''' What will be do when people start a project and abandon it? The material will just sit around Wikipedia, taking up space.
# '''No selection - rejection process:''' If this idea takes off, we may get have more special project pages than encyclopedia pages, and no way to control the influx.
# '''How do we enforce the rules?''' If people are only permitted to ''start'' projects here, how do we make them move on when the time comes? Who decides when the project has matured enough to leave? What if they refuse? What will we do when people find content from a project that has moved on and start to add to it?

I know that we have [[AmbientCalculiOnline]], but it is merely one page of external links, and hasn't caused us any problems. If we open the doors wide open, it could endanger the whole encyclopedia project. As Bryce said, wiki software isn't very tricky to set up. And there are also servers like http://www.swiki.net that exist for people to set up wikis on anything they like. These would be better options, as I think the cons far outweigh the pros of letting projects start on Wikipedia.
----
I am not convinced, though you've made some good points.  Let's look at the arguments presented so far.  I think I have adequate replies to all of them.
# '''Confusion of content:''' We can have people who begin projects here specially label them as such.  See [[Irish Sessions]] as an example.
# '''Name collisions:''' This will not happen as long as the projects stick to subpages of the main project (again, see [[Irish Sessions]] as an example).
# '''Abandoned projects:''' If a project is abandoned, eventually, I or you will delete it.
# '''No selection - rejection process:''' Actually, I very much doubt that many people are going to start projects here.  I am just suggesting that a few people (people who are reading this) ask their friends to get wiki-type projects started here.  I'm not suggesting that we loudly advertise Wikipedia as a place to start non-encyclopedia wikis.  (We've got plans for that, anyway.)
# '''How do we enforce the rules?''' &quot;If people are only permitted to ''start'' projects here, how do we make them move on when the time comes?&quot; -- I post a warning, and they move it.  If they don't, I delete it.
The essential point here is that there is some ''risk'' that, if poorly managed, non-encyclopedic projects that begin life here would threaten to dilute the encyclopedia.  I acknowledge that there is some risk along these lines, but I think it's very small, for the above reasons.  I think the benefits of getting new people familiar with both the wiki format and Wikipedia outweigh these small risks: it means more people contributing (encyclopedia articles) to Wikipedia.  --Larry
----
I am not convinced, though you've made some good counterpoints. ;-) I still maintain, however, that encouraging people to sign up for their own wiki at swiki.net would be better. Or perhaps a separate wiki could be set up, something like a project hatchery. But anyway, my points have been made. I just want my objection noted in the log... -- [[STG]]

----
How about if we add a new wiki, akin to the international ones, called projects.wikipedia.com, and let them play there? --AxelBoldt
----
Actually, it turns out that Bomis is going to set up a website for this.  :-) --[[LMS]]
----
Beautiful. I retract all objections. -- [[STG]]
----
I want to add [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]] as an example of something that's halfway between Wikipedia entry and separate project. See [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack/In Memoriam]].

I'm pretty strongly in favor of encouraging not-obviously Wikipedia projects to be added to Wikipedia. -- TheCunctator

Should we use profanity? 

Some people might wonder why this needs to be asked at all. After all, what place does profanity have in an encyclopedia? Upon closer examination, however, there are some cases in which an article might require words considered to be impolite, or even taboo. A good example would be an article on [[wikipedia:profanity|profanity]] itself. Such an article could not use phrases such as &quot;the f word&quot; and still be taken seriously. There are alternatives, such as the tried-and-true &quot;f*ck&quot;, could be used in such an such article, but this is not a perfect solution, as it is only useful to people already familiar with the word. A person attempting to find out which words to avoid in a language not his/her own might be confused by such obscured spelling.

== Scopes ==

There are different scopes which may have different policies regarding profanities:
* A lemma where a profanity is the subject of the lemma.
* A lemma where a profanity is not subject of the lemma.
* Article text where a profanity is the subject of the text.
* Article text where a profanity is used in the description of something else.
* Discussion text where a profanity is the subject of the text.
* Discussion text where a profanity is used in the description of something else.

== Pros and Cons ==

Let's look at some of the pros and cons of using profanity directly in Wikipedia articles:

===Pros===
# '''Provides complete accuracy.''' If swear words are used in their normal form, it doesn't leave those unfamiliar with the word guessing. As an encyclopedia project, Wikipedia is striving to be highly accurate.
# '''Gives Wikipedians more academic freedom.''' People are often somewhat nervous about doing articles on certain subjects if reference must be made to offensive words and phrases. If a person knows that she won't have to fight with the community over the professional use of such language, he or she would feel more comfortable about writing an article on the subject.
# '''Provides evidence of objectivity.''' If profanity is necessary in an article, and it is used in a professional fashion, it is one way to showing that Wikipedia can produce objective articles on controversial subjects.
# '''Allows illustrative descriptions.''' Profanity may be used to better emphasize a specific point of view, as well as a given description.

===Cons===
# '''Wikipedia will be blocked by offensive content filters.''' In fact, it's happening already. I was at an Internet cafe yesterday and tried to check [[Recent Changes]]. One swear word caused the filtering program to flag en.wikipedia.org as a site &quot;not suitable for public viewing&quot;. As many schools use such software, this would especially hurt Wikipedia's value as an educational tool.
# '''Certain people may not be permitted to use Wikipedia.''' This is related to the first con, only this time, the filters are other people. The big example would be parents not letting their children use Wikipedia because of some offensive content.
# '''Offended people will not contribute to Wikipedia.''' There may be very intelligent, knowledgeable people who would be turned off of Wikipedia simply because they are offended by ''any'' use of profanity, no matter what the context.

Personally, I am undecided. On the one hand, I want to provide complete, accurate information, and I don't want to have to shy away from topics that some people might find offensive. On the other hand, I don't want Wikipedia to be banished from schools and public access terminals all over the world. What do you think? -- [[Stephen Gilbert]]
:Actually, this topic has already been discussed, linked somewhere via [[Wikipedia: Wikipedia: Policies and guidelines |Wikipedia policy]] (which ''really, really'' needs to be totally refactored--the whole area).

== From the Information Hound: ==

To Stephen Gilbert, or any others it may concern: &lt;br&gt;

Please stick to the no-censorship policy.    Wikipedia won't be banned from &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; public access terminals.  And besides, Wikipedia's being banned in any given millieu or venue is not something you have any direct control over anyway. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Everything&lt;/i&gt; offends somebody.   Just remain objective - as being so is the scholarly and encyclopedic thing to do - and don't worry about it.
----
One thing not addressed so far in Wikipedia -- at least from my limited experience -- is the issue of age/maturity-appropriate content.  Censorship aside, six-year-olds need to read significantly different materials, both in terms of content and language, than adults.  Providing some sort of mechanism to loosely classify content -- and to make appropriate-level content easier to find -- isn't directly censorship.  It may make life easier for potential censors; on the other hand, it may make potential censors less inclined to hassle Wikipedia over sections that are more risque.
:This suggestion is right now practically impossible to implement, though in the future it might be possible.  It's now impossible because there is no way to persuade everyone to agree to label the articles they work on according to age level, let alone get them to agree on a scheme in the first place.  Anyway, Wikipedia is not for children...yet.  (Though nearly 100% of the pages here are perfectly safe for children of reasonably open-minded parents; &quot;reasonably open-minded,&quot; I say, because some parents might not want their children to see the [[en:God|God]] entry, since that might raise too many questions in their minds.) --[[LMS]]

: There is no way this encyclopedia can get around the censorship filters, so I don't think there is any reason to even try.  Even if we eliminate profanity, there are articles on anal sex, sexually transmitted disease, and so forth, that are likely to get censored.  Even articles that mention breast cancer could get censored simply because they use the word &quot;breast&quot; (it's been known to happen).  So instead of trying to cater this encyclopedia to the bizarre whims of censorship software, I think we should instead simply ignore that issue and try to do what we think is the right thing, censors be damned.  Oh whoops, I just used the word &quot;damned&quot;! - Egern

:Personally, I think that to some degree Wikipedia is already set up this way by it's very nature as an encyclopedia. You mentioned above that children will be viewing material that is significantly different from what adults will be viewing. It would obviously be inappropriate and unencyclopedic to use the word &quot;fuck&quot; in an article about [[w:Barney &amp; Friends|Barney &amp; Friends]], or to have an image of a nude woman in an article like [[w:US States|US States]]. My point is that the likelyhood of children ''stumbling'' upon obscene material on Wikipedia is pretty slim&amp;ndash;much slimmer, I'd imageine, than on Google, for instance&amp;ndash;because materials inappropriate for children would almost always be unencyclopedic in articles that children are likely to view, and so would not be permitted by the community. On the other hand, if a child is ''searching'' Wikipedia for things like [[w:Boobs|Boobs]], or [[w:Sex|Sex]], or [[w:Shit|Shit]], or [[w:Fuck|Fuck]], then they know perfectly well what they're doing, and it's between them and their guardians. Kids have been doing the same thing for as long as there've been enyclopedias in class rooms and libraries. [[User:Bmearns|Bmearns]] 13:12, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

Google has a much more difficult time censoring the internet then the job at Wikipedia is. Also there needs to be an area to imput passwords if Wikipedia is serious about keeping profanity. Also being objective is related to responsibility. Do not keep the Encyclopedia UNEDITED.  It has information like, &quot;Bikes are leg powered vehicles.&quot; Not, &quot;This exact cuss word can be traced back to the greeks. I have a lot more info like this. I can't properly describe a PS3 Console.&quot; Wikipedia needs to stop this crazy and ridiculous endeavor into hyper free speech. Why doesn't Kenny Chesney's wiki not say Kenny Chesney 400 times in it? Why is it so difficult to figure out what the right decision is? I wondered if the Matrix sequels were any good. Lots of intelligent arguments from both sides. Oh wait. DUH! It's the Matrix. THOSE MOVIES WERE AWESOME! Seriously what are the arguments for the blatant cussing. How is the use of a word that is labeled BAD (ie. Bad words) somehow being considered good. If someone offered you a bad triangle block of cheese and a good triangle block of cheese, how in the world are you going to be convinced that the bad cheese is good? IT'S ON THE PACKAGE! Good luck with this whole, we're professional businessmen and professional street talkers thing. &quot;It's like being Businessmen who cuss!&quot; If wikipedia had it's way the Lava article would turn into lava andmelteveryonescomputer. Wikipedia is dumb for this. I know that. Let's say they have a point. Maybe we should be able to put in cuss words. What's next? Let's check it out.


(Cuss word) da da da ... the history of... da da da I just proved I cuss and I research stuff... da da da ...and many more words...

da da da it's for the information of society... da da da ... and in closing... it's a word most people can't say and we don't want many people to read it. Good luck with all the information you just learned.


*am i the only one who wants to fight the guy who mentioned ancient times when discussing cuss words?* It's wack! That's wack. I use to go to middle school. Saying you cuss because of historical things is very hyper-wack.


I have an address. I will fight these morons in the street. Tell them my e-mail address and I'll give them my home address. If they bring cuss words onto my computer again I will punch them in the teeth/face/mouth all of that. I think they are ugly, dumb, and probably smell bad. I will uppercut a Wikipedia fool in there mouth..

WHO WANTS SOME??? I'll knock one of you old volunteer fools down with a dropkick to the jugular. 

Here's what I think. That sissy cuss word writing article guy hides behind those words cause someone like me will attack him in his sleep if he try's that dirt eating stuff with me. 

Thank you. Sorry if I did not format this properly. Please direct it to its proper location.

== Possibilities ==
The following content was in &quot;Wikipedia Policy/Foul Language&quot; on the main wikipedia site:

Q. What ought our policy to be on foul language?

A few possibilities to kick off the discussion.

#We must absolutely avoid it at all times.
#We ought to discourage it in most articles, on the grounds of quality control and &lt;i&gt;encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt; style, but in some articles it can be necessary and useful for completeness.  Tact is important.
#We should allow it when it is warranted. We should not fuss over it.
#We shouldn't worry about it at all -- any article can contain foul language.
#We should require it in every article.

Number 2, for me please.  Mind you, I just used the f*** word in [[w:punk rock]] (as a direct, justifiable example, mind) so what do I know? -- [[User:Gareth Owen|Gareth Owen]]

I'd agree, Gareth. -- [[Larry Sanger]]

Same here - WojPob

2/3 Sounds about right to me--I'd go a little further and recommend that (1) If an article needs them, use them; mark the page with RSAC to make censorware work, and add a warning so we can truthfully claim we're doing our part to keep the page away from the kiddies--maybe some checkboxes on the submit form could automate this? (2) In an article for general consumption when it is necessary to refer to such a word (say when using a politician's exact quote), we should render it in such a way that the adults can figure out what's really being said, e.g., &quot;f***&quot; rather than simply &quot;****&quot; or &quot;&lt;expletive&gt;&quot;.  Accuracy is important. -- [[User:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]

While I agree with 2/3, I do not think that quotes should be obscured as &quot;f***&quot;. This makes it difficult for non-native speakers and also gives evidence of a dangerous tendency to self-censorship. If there are organizations out there which censor based on usage of specific words, even in quotes, then we shouldn't empower those organizations by adapting our standards to their requirements. --[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

Number 2 for me, and while I agree with LDC on many things, I'm not interested in endorsing RSAC in any way.  --KQ

----

&lt;i&gt;Is this the emerging consensus?  Profanity should be used only where appropriate, meaning primarily where it is necessary and useful for completeness and accuracy, and we should not fuss over it too much.  This is essentially (2) and (3) above.  Another way to look at it is that the Wikipedia ought not to swear, but it can quote the swearing of others, when historically or otherwise important.&lt;/i&gt;

----

Folks, we need to remember that some people (especially young ones) are using the Web as filtered by dumb [[w:censorware]], and the inclusion of any &quot;forbidden&quot; words on [[Wikipedia]] pages may make it inaccessible to them.

: That is a problem of and for &quot;censorware&quot;. The solution is certainly not to just abide to whatever some group claims to be censorable. What about increasing awareness on the grave shortcomings of such systems?  
----
We did remember that, thanks, as you would see if you read the above more carefully.  There's really no need to shout; it doesn't make your point any more true and certainly won't force anyone to agree with you, though it might incline some fence-sitters to disagree with you.  --[[KQ]]

:Hmm, I wrote that and I don't remember the &quot;shouting&quot; at the time (although I was new[er] to Wikipedia then and may have done it through misuse of the Wikipedia editing conventions). Anyway, edited the &quot;shouting&quot; out. Have a good one.

----
How can we pretend to be an authorative, objective academic work if we acquiesce to the arbitrary whims of censorware vendors? In an endeavor as large as an encyclopedia, there will '''always''' be people who take offense at certain portions. If we start with words like &quot;f*ck&quot; and &quot;sh*t&quot; just so that we can slip past a few censorware filters, what next? Should we take descriptions of various non-standard sexual practices out? Or perhaps take descriptions of sex out altogether? Fundamentalist Christian schools might take offense at the historical (rather than strictly dogmatic) account of the life of Jesus, label it heresy, and block us for that. Ditto for any other fundamentalist group that doesn't appreciate a neutral and objective description of their history. Banning profanity is the beginning of a long and slippery slope. If you wish to say anything useful, you're going to offend someone. Saying &quot;fuck&quot; is absolutely necessary when attempting to express all of human knowledge. This very discussion here is in itself evidence of that.

One must take the middle path here. One should neither gratuitously use &quot;fuck&quot; at every turn simply for the purpose of offending people, nor absolutely avoid using any language whatsoever that might offend someone somewhere when it is indeed appropriate to use such language.

Encyclopedias are supposed to be just that -- encyclopedic, volumes about all human knowledge, ''not'' sanitized subsets of human knowledge that probably won't offend people.
:No worries; since this essay was written, Wikipedia has followed the policy that you are suggesting now. There have been no efforts to &quot;rate&quot; our pages according to censorware specifications, and articles on [[w:profanity]] are written in a professional and uncensored manner. -- [[User:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]] 14:00 Nov 28, 2002 (UTC)

----

There are content rating systems that can be applied per page with meta-tags.  These could help the availablility of wikipedia in schools.  
IMHO, Wikipedia should be as available as possible without compromising freedom.   
Such a system would allow this.

See http://www.w3.org/PICS/iacwcv2.htm and http://www.w3.org/PICS/.

How can the tags be added by authors?  
By using tick boxes or radio buttons at the end of the page? Is this too complex?

:As noted earlier, though, where do we stop? We have enough [[edit wars]] as it is, without trying to reach an agreement about whether that checkbox should be checked or not. It's quite possible that every single article in Wikipedia is offensive to someone. I think it's enough that Wikipedia has a [[w:Wikipedia:Content disclaimer]]. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 15:52 4 Jul 2003 (UTC)
----

Encyclopedias are not, in practice, collections of all human knowledge as most such knowledge is irrelevant (e.g. what I had for breakfast).  The use of expletives is indicitive of poor vocabulary.  It is always possible to convey meaning without it.  The only necessary usage is in quotation marks.

:Of course, one is more confident of one's own vocabulary when one can correctly spell &quot;indicative.&quot; :-) Since we strive to be NPOV, it's not too likely that profanity, as such, will be necessary outside of some form of quotation, but that depends on how far your definition of &quot;profanity&quot; extends. Some (perhaps many) words deemed profane in one context are perfectly good words in another context (bitch, damn, hell, etc.) In the context of discussing canine reproduction, the word &quot;bitch&quot; can certainly be used outside of quotations, but we're not too likely to state &quot;John Doe is a son of a bitch&quot; in an article about John Doe. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 15:52 4 Jul 2003 (UTC)

How about a Wikitax tag that flags a word profane.  Additionally, articles can also have a flag to block the whole page, which is set by anyone who edits the page.  There will also be a corresponding user option to block flagged words (on by default).  When a word is blocked, it is replaced by &lt;censored&gt;.  If a wikilink goes to a blocked page, it should turn '''black''' and if clicked go to a page that says &quot;This page was censored for your protection.  If you are over 18, you can turn off this preference in [[MediaWiki:Preferences|prefs page]].&quot;

We will have to give guests a (dumbed down) version of the preference page that has the option to unblock the words (creating a cookie), as well as including it on the Special:User Preferences page.

So, how does it sound?

I just looked in my dictionary that I've had since school, and the word &quot;fuck&quot; is in there as well as a number of other profanities.  The dictionary is, in my opinion, a professionally written book. 

I think that option 2 or 3 would be the best option.  

If the article writer wants to use &quot;f***&quot; they could even link it to an article on the censored word explaining showing it in it's entirety and why it appears with stars.  That way people won't get offended in the first instance, and if they want/need more information on the word or don't understand it, they can find out more.

Should offencive pages goto &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;special:offencive/''Pagename'']]? That page would warn about the content and have a continue &amp; go back link. The continue would go to [&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;''wiki''.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=''article''&amp;warn=no] and the back would goto [javascript:history.back(1)].

Idea uv zzo38

Here is simple 3 rules:
# Do not use profanity unless you need to.
# If you do use profanity, do not senser it, rite it exactly.
# Do not put pictures of pornography. If you need to, instead put a link to a web site with that picture and indicate that the link is bad.

----
#4 is fine. What is &quot;profane&quot; is all relative. If Wikipedia agrees to a set of dogmatic laws about profanity, it will eventually becomed biased. I doubt any 'profane' words would be used in technical writing, anyways.

==New discussion==

I guess this conversation is long dead by now, but in case anyone's still reading it...&lt;br/&gt;
The fact that the first several votes, and the over all majority of later votes, were for number 2 and/or 3 above, indicates to me that this is just common sense. It certainly seems that way to me; obviously [[wiktionary:gratuitous|gratuitous]]-anything is inherently unprofessional and unencyclopedic, whether it's profanity, violence, sex, religion, or slap-stick-comedy. But so is shying away from potentially sensitive material that is otherwise perfectly appropriate for this project. As mentioned at least a few times above, dictionaries and encyclopedias have always contained entries that some people feel are offensive or inappropriate. I might also point out that people who react in such a way are very often the same people who want to restrict the knowledge available to people in other ways&amp;ndash;such as banning certain books, or removing sex-education from public schools&amp;ndash;which is at absolute odds with the goal of this encycopledia, which is to spread as much useful knowledge as possible.

As far as filters and censorware, my overall gut reaction is to hell with them; but I do understand the concern about having wikipedia available in schools, especially. But let's put out humility aside for a minute, and recognize that Wikipedia is '''huge''', and getting bigger all the time. It's an entirely legitimate body of useful knowledge that any good school administrator should be breaking their backs over to make sure it's available to their students. As it becomes easier and easier for any idiot with a web connection to set up their own website (very mixed feelings on this), it becomes harder and harder to find legitimate and useful information on the web. Wikipedia is a fabulous solution to that problem, and I think it's only a (brief) matter of time before this realization sweeps across the education profession. Of course, there will always be a handful of book burners here and there, probably the same ones who won't let their classes read ''Catcher in the Rye'', but we cannot cater to closed minded extremists attempting to limit knowledge. And for the rest, they'll quickly realize that there are plenty of ways '''not''' to block Wikipedia, while still blocking other inappropriate material (e.g., whitelisting wikipedia.org on their filters).

* i say 4 or would settle for 3, profanity i reckon must be used correctly and not overdone like the word like shouldn't like be used like every like 3 seconds dude like omg! similarly we should say that george bush got off his a** today and made his weekly radio address btw he beat kerry's a** and didnt even cheat this time A! its just silly to overuse anyword its not encyclopedic. and no offense but most filters are made by socially conservative companies and routenely (yeah how do you spell that? wiktionary next stop) filterout the words vagina and gay even at san francisco's city college library... so they just had to take the filters off and put up signs that ask people to please not look at porn for non-research purposes, because it was filtering the advocate and even myspace. oh yeah and who was the dumb fuck that suggested number 5, duuuuumb. unless it was a joke then replace &quot;dumb fuck&quot; and &quot;duuuumb&quot; with &quot;lol&quot; and &quot;sorry, my bad&quot; [[User:71.142.67.103|71.142.67.103]] 20:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

*Is it too late to add another opinion?  Some articles require profanity, and some quotes are historically important though they contain profanity (&quot;D*mn the torpedoes, Full speed ahead&quot; comes to mind), in addition standards for profanity can be widely varied, for instance &quot;God,&quot; were Wikipedia to properly censor 'profanity' we'd have to re-direct all permutations to &quot;G*D&quot;  On the other hand excessive use of profanity is unencyclopedic and looks amateurish, personally I think that it's okay within quotes and whatnot, but not in extrapolated summary text.

* I really dont want to be a person who bumps, but wikipedia has articles that might require some profanity. However, most people will eventually use profanity at some point in there life so trying to keep people from using profanity is sort of pointless. A simple mispelling like for instance, fck or fuk, $hit, kunt, or biatch. I curse a lot but do try and control it, and kids who have parents who curse will likely do it themselves. However, although I do curse a lot, I never say or type out the n-word, which is definitely a word that should be kept off of articles unless an article is called n.i.g you know the rest. Censoring profanity is pointless since people will find ways around it by using methods like kunt or kock, $hit, fuk, f*ck, c*nt, sh*t. However, going to a random page and typing every cuss word is really not to smart. [[User:Marauder09|Marauder09]] 00:23, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

* For the actual content there is only one correct solution: If some sort of profanity is object of an article, a citation etc., the profanity has to be included. That means correctly included, not with &quot;*&quot;. The describing text itself of course should never comprise &quot;foul language&quot;. Everything else would be simply wrong for an encyclopedia etc. It's different on discussion pages: As long as it does not include offense, there is room. But it should be clear, that this should occur seldom enough and in a slight manner, otherwise it would already be offensive. [[User:Tomdo08|Tomdo08]] 04:03, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


_ New Conversation _

A professionally done encyclopedia would not allow the actual cuss word to be used. They would discuss origins of profanity and the negative cultural impact they have or a neutral view on there role in society. I don't think anyone finds the use of the F-word over 50 times in an article very confusing as to whether it is appropriate or not. This is suppose to be a version of a paid for professional encyclopedia only free. This conversation over whether these cuss words belong here is the beginning of the end for this project when a broader and more influential audience get's a hold of this. Also this encyclopedia is used in schools frequently. 

1 It's suppose to be a professional Encyclopeda only made by volunteers and free. 
2 Its differences were meant to be about it's ability to easily discuss current music, technology, fads, etc.
3 It's advertised as an Encyclopedia for everyone. That means there is to be no cuss words. It will infringe on the law easily.

==My two cents==
Profanity has its place at this site in certain circumstances, but it should probably be avoided in most circumstances for the sake of professionalism. Other sites, such as Dictionary.com and Merrium-Webster.com, have definitions of some of the most offensive words out there. Content filters can't filter every site that contains such words without blocking the vast majority of the internet. Wikipedia is blocked in my school district for two reasons: offensive content and abuse (i.e. vandalism) from students at a rival school. I think we're the only school district in the state of Florida currently blocking Wikipedia, but there seems to be an increasing demand for it as more and more people are complaining about indecency.

      <sha1>i7wdf4y1yeh8fufqeid0r75kqc7adui</sha1>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Saturday, September 1, 2001, 12:00 PM -- Some recent events on Wikipedia have raised a question that has been idly bothering me for well over a year now: what ''is'' an encyclopedia, anyway?  I'm not so much interested in historical definitions; I'm interested in a sort of prescriptive, revisionist definition that Nupedia and Wikipedia can actually use (after some debate, perhaps) in conceiving of their projects.

First, what ''sort of knowledge'' is included in an encyclopedia?  The following is going to be more or less a ramble, not a careful academic discussion.

I think I have said sometimes that an encyclopedia is a repository of ''empirical'' knowledge, but this is not quite right.  On nearly all accounts, math and logic are nonempirical knowledge, and yet it is entirely appropriate that we include that sort of knowledge in an encyclopedia. I think it might be better to say that it is ''synthetic'' knowledge, as opposed to ''analytic.''  (Philosophers, please forgive me for glossing over many subtleties here.  I'm just getting one view of the lay of the land in this essay.)  Analytic knowledge (as Kant would say, approximately) is the sort of knowledge you can get simply by an analysis of a concept (as he put it, &quot;the predicate is contained in the subject,&quot; as in the sentence, &quot;that bachelor is unmarried&quot;).  By extension, we can view analytic knowledge as the result of analysis of the meanings of words.  Synthetic knowledge, then, is ''everything else''--non-analytic knowledge.

So, putting concerns about the analytic-synthetic distinction aside, we could say that an encyclopedia is a repository of synthetic knowledge.  This, however, will not do, because there is plenty of synthetic knowledge that has no place in an encyclopedia; for instance, I took the dog for a walk this morning and had cereal for breakfast.  In theory, we ''could'' include such knowledge in an encyclopedia (there would be no problem categorizing it, for one thing: put it on a page titled &quot;What Larry Sanger Did on September 1, 2001&quot;).

Perhaps we're interested in ''general'' facts, not particular ones.  But this isn't right, because there are very many particular facts that are of the utmost importance, such as the particular fact that John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln at a play performance in 1865.

So then we might say that we are interested in ''important'' synthetic knowledge, admitting that some of both general and particular knowledge is utterly ''un''important (we needn't report in an encyclopedia that 236+362=598, but it's perfectly general).  But this raises the question of what &quot;important knowledge&quot; means--what might seem to be important to me will seem utterly trivial to you.  For example, I'm very interested in the life of an Irish fiddler named Mickey Doherty, who died in 1970.  I would love to see an article about Mickey's life.  But you might think that that's so utterly trivial and unimportant that we shouldn't have such articles in the encyclopedia.

The latter would be a serious, vexed question if we were working with a paper encyclopedia.  But since we're not, we can generously welcome into the fold of the ''adequately'' important nearly anything that anyone deems important.  Still, this description (&quot;nearly anything that anyone deems important&quot;) lacks any sort of prescriptive purchase.  It's important to me that I finish this essay within a reasonable amount of time, but that's not a fact that belongs in an encyclopedia.  And if we say that &quot;adequately important&quot; means &quot;anything anyone deems important enough to put in an encyclopedia,&quot; we are committing a sort of circularity.  It's not strictly circular, of course: in order to determine whether fact F should be in the encyclopedia, we check around to see if anyone deems F important enough to put it in an encyclopedia.  But there is a practical sort of circularity: suppose I ''don't know'' whether F is important enough, and no one has any opinions on the subject.  How do I decide?

Well, I'd propose the following as one way in part to make the determination.  If, when Nupedia and/or Wikipedia are powering along at their most active rate, some years in the future, it is ''practical'' for the members of the project to keep track of ''all facts similar to'' fact F, then we should keep track of F.  For instance, if it is practical, at that point, for us to keep track of all living composers who have had their work performed by some community's orchestra, then we should keep track of each of them.  If, on the other hand, this proves to be ''im''possible, then we shouldn't.

But this still leaves it undecided whether ''any'' of the &quot;facts similar to F&quot; are important at all.  So I'm forced to come up with some sort of rule.  But this doesn't seem too hard, if I'm making a rough first guess: we can always say that one fact, F1, is more important than another fact, F2, if F1 has had a greater impact on a greater number of people than F2.  Exactly how that is determined is unclear--this formula doesn't help at all with the borderline cases.  But it does seem fairly clear that, according to this formula, it's more important that the U.S. exploded an atomic bomb over Hiroshima than that I ate cereal for breakfast this morning.

Now, suppose that, after a great deal more philosophical wrangling, we had arrived at some reasonable and useful account of &quot;adequately important synthetic knowledge.&quot;  I would then want to point out that, as epistemologists are fond of pointing out, there are two types of knowledge, namely declarative and procedural, or knowledge of the truth of propositions and knowledge of how to do things.  With some exceptions, most traditional multivolume encyclopedias have focused on declarative knowledge at the expense of codifying procedural knowledge.  But I see no good reason for this, especially for Nupedia and Wikipedia, which do not have the space constraints that older encyclopedias had.  (The only thing that constrains size, actually, is the average number of people, working an average amount of time on the thing any given day.  This is the main reason why Wikipedia is so much bigger than Nupedia.)

There's an entirely different consideration to bear in mind in characterizing the sort of knowledge that is in encyclopedias.  We do not mean knowledge in a strict sense, in the sense that philosophers were after when they produced the old definition, &quot;S knows that p if, and only if, p is true, S believes that p, and S has a justified belief that p.&quot;  Rather, we mean ''alleged'' knowledge, or information ''taught as knowledge,'' or, we might say, &quot;educated belief.&quot;  When postmodernists use the word &quot;know&quot; as in &quot;what this community knows,&quot; they are using the term in this sense; it doesn't mean ''belief,'' precisely, but rather something more like ''belief that is generally accepted, by some people, as knowledge or as very probably true.''  But I'm not going to try to give an account of what sort of knowledge this is (it's a sense of the word that analytic philosophers actually haven't given a lot of attention to, except to say that the sense exists).  I'm just going to call it &quot;human knowledge&quot; and move on.

There is one important result, however, of the fact that general encyclopedias codify &quot;human knowledge&quot;: it is that ''it is appropriate'' that general encyclopedias be written from a neutral point of view.  Where one controversial view is presented as fact, or is asserted as being probably true when a substantial number of experts or concerned parties would disagree with that, the reader of the encyclopedia is given a ''skewed view'' about what &quot;human knowledge&quot; of the topic consists of.  To be given a really accurate view of &quot;how the experts think&quot; about a topic, it is important to represent, fairly, ''all'' the views of the experts, whoever they might be.

Getting back to the main task at hand, I would say that encyclopedias codify adequately important synthetic &quot;human knowledge,&quot; both declarative and procedural.  Let us call this ''encyclopedic knowledge'' for short.  Encyclopedic knowledge is the sort of knowledge that we ought to find in general encyclopedias.

This might (or might not) articulate what sort of knowledge an encyclopedia contains, but to say what an encyclopedia is, it is not enough to say that it is a text that contains encyclopedic knowledge.  I could write ''one'' article that codifies some chunk of encyclopedic knowledge, but that would not constitute an encyclopedia.  In order to be an encyclopedia, there has to be ''a lot'' of articles; and if we're talking about a general encyclopedia, they are articles about ''everything'' (well, everything within the constraints of the aforementioned account of encyclopedic knowledge).  So we might say: an encyclopedia is a text that contains articles expressing ''all'' of encyclopedic knowledge.

There's much more to be said, but this looks like a good first stab. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Encyclopedias have always been related to a whole series of pedagogical functions.  In particular they've been used as tools for introducing someone to the group of subjects deemed important by those constructing the encyclopedias.  This process is part of the enculturation process, and that means that those who produce encyclopedias have an obligation to present ''warranted'' information.  The combination of the introductory nature of the pedagogical function of the encyclopedia and the requirement that all information in the encyclopedia have the elusive quality called '''warrant''' means that encyclopedias have historically been inherently conservative in terms of what ''&quot;knowledge&quot;'' they include.

As far as I can tell the wiki process has exactly the opposite effect.  Ward's Wiki developed first as a PaternsRepository, and then became a resource for XP programmers.  Both of these fields were new at the time, and they grew up through and around the wiki process, with information on Ward's Wiki receiving warrant through the collaborative wiki process which helped a culture to come to agreement about where to draw the distinction between knowledge and opinion in these fields.  Though the technology is new, every academic discipline is defined by a community who follows a roughly similar process.  

As I see it, there are contradictory pressures at work on the wikipedia, we want to function both in the traditional pedagogic role of the encyclopedia, but we also want to be a resource for those who want to take it further, and participate with the academic community in understanding the cutting edge knowledge on various subjects.  But the very requirement to &quot;say only things all reasonable people can agree to&quot; which has informed the traditional encyclopedia and the pedagogical roles which surround that process can be coercively inimical to the  desire create an academic community, which is why people like Peter Wozniak have left the Wiki process, or decided to only commit to creating lightweight, introductory knowledge with no research behind them. 

I don't know how we want to deal with this tension, but I think that this is the essential thing we need to do if we want to define what kind of thing the wikipedia will be.  That is not to say that I think the distinctions between the kind of knowledge you make in the above article are unimportant, but I think the key question is what kind and how much warrant must a statement have to be included in the Wikipedia, and what kind of structures are we going to implement in order to accommodate both introductory material, and material which may be of interest to more serious students. --[[Mark Christensen]] 
----
Mark, it sounds like you are after a more careful explanation of what I was calling &quot;human knowledge.&quot;  We agree that encyclopedias are not repositories of what just anybody thinks--they're repositories of expert knowledge, more or less, or what passes for expert knowledge.  I guess I agree that, to qualify as such, this knowledge has to have some sort of warrant, in the sense that indeed there are certain criteria a bit of information would have to meet to constitute &quot;human knowledge&quot; or &quot;expert knowledge.&quot;  I'd admit there must be ''that'' sort of warrant, but I'm not sure if this is what you mean.  Your question seems to be what sort of criteria for warrant we should recognize.  In ''practical'' terms, the thing to look for is to look at what recognized experts in a field believe.  However that might be, you seem to identify &quot;warrant&quot; (in one sense anyway) with a conservative tendency (i.e., to say what the experts believe).  Then you say that the wiki format ''militates against'' this sort of conservatism and therefore against (that type of) warrant:

:As I see it, there are contradictory pressures at work on the wikipedia, we want to function both in the traditional pedagogic role of the encyclopedia, but we also want to be a resource for those who want to take it further, and participate with the academic community in understanding the cutting edge knowledge on various subjects.  But the very requirement to &quot;say only things all reasonable people can agree to&quot; which has informed the traditional encyclopedia and the pedagogical roles which surround that process can be coercively inimical to the  desire create an academic community, which is why people like Peter Wozniak have left the Wiki process, or decided to only commit to creating lightweight, introductory knowledge with no research behind them.

I think the above contains three (what I think are) confusions, and I hope it will help for me to explain them:
#I would say that we aren't ''essentially'' engaged in pedagogy here--I won't dispute the historical point (I have no idea whether it's true).  Sure, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to learn from our articles, but that does not mean that the best description of the function of this encyclopedia--or many other modern encyclopedias--is a pedagogical one.  When I say that it's a repository of human knowledge, I mean it; one can ''learn'' from the contents of a repository of knowledge, of course.  One can also learn a lot from the contents of a library, but that doesn't make the function of a library primarily pedagogical.  One can even strongly encourage that people make it as easy as possible to learn from the contents of the repository, but even that doesn't entail that the ''purpose'' or ''function'' of the repository is ''primarily'' one of teaching students.
#I would also say that we are ''not'' encouraging &quot;cutting edge&quot; ''research,'' though we certainly do encourage ''reporting on'' the latest research about nearly anything.  This is another subtle but important distinction.  It means that if Piotr wants to come in and advance the latest theories about the function of sleep (just to take an example), he is not free to do so.  What he's free to do is to report about the latest theories about the function of sleep, hopefully without advancing any one of them as the correct theory (unless, of course, scientists have recently achieved a general agreement on the subject, which many of us find highly unlikely, Piotr notwithstanding).
# When you speak of &quot;the very requirement to 'say only things all reasonable people can agree to' which has informed the traditional encyclopedia and the pedagogical roles which surround that process,&quot; I'm not sure ''exactly'' what you mean.  In (3a) and (3b) I will address two different interpretations of it.
:3a. We certainly don't have a requirement to try to come up with a ''single viewpoint'' on each issue that somehow represents &quot;the reasonable point of view,&quot; such that ''that'' becomes the official Wikipedia view of the subject.  I doubt this is what you mean, but it might be.  Whether or not there ever was such a widespread requirement for traditional encyclopedias, we have been tolerably clear that that is ''not'' a requirement we have for Wikipedia (or Nupedia).  I at least have repeated this point I imagine a half-dozen times.  This alleged requirement would represent a misunderstanding of the NeutralPointOfView.  I and others have said many times that what we want is fair statements of the different possible views on different controversial subjects--and we leave it up to the reader to decide which is correct.  I doubt this is the traditional approach, actually.
:3b. On the other hand, in interpreting &quot;the very requirement to 'say only things all reasonable people can agree to' which has informed the traditional encyclopedia and the pedagogical roles which surround that process,&quot; you might want me to include ''fair statements of competing views'' among the items about which all reasonable people can agree--and in that case, I would say that Wikipedia and Nupedia do indeed have such a requirement (although it's not necessarily connected with any central pedagogical role).

Now that I've explained what I think were the confused assumptions behind your point, let's return to the point itself: &quot;people like Peter Wozniak have left the Wiki process, or decided to only commit to creating lightweight, introductory knowledge with no research behind them.&quot;  This you regard as a problem, with the items I said were confusions as the cause of the problem.  Well, that's interesting.  First--without naming names--if indeed there are highly-qualified people who don't feel inclined to write about their specializations for Wikipedia, and ''the reason'' for this is that they think Wikipedia is insufficiently ''accepting'' of reports about cutting-edge research, they're simply mistaken.  Perhaps, indeed, they have misconstrued the nonbias policy (as I explained); or perhaps, as you seem to be implying, they think Wikipedia aims too much at conservative pedagogy.  But I think there's a more plausible explanation of any such problem (see below).  I also deny that it's much of a problem (also see below).

With all this analysis finished, it should be reasonably easy to understand my reaction to your last paragraph:
:I don't know how we want to deal with this tension, but I think that this is the essential thing we need to do if we want to define what kind of thing the wikipedia will be.  That is not to say that I think the distinctions between the kind of knowledge you make in the above article are unimportant, but I think the key question is what kind and how much warrant must a statement have to be included in the Wikipedia, and what kind of structures are we going to implement in order to accommodate both introductory material, and material which may be of interest to more serious students. 
First, I deny that there is any such tension.  I will explain that more soon.  Second, I don't think there's any important question of encyclopedia policy that rests on the question &quot;how much warrant a statement must have&quot; in order to be included in Wikipedia.  As I said, it seems the only sort of &quot;warrant&quot; a candidate bit of information has to have is the warrant for thinking that it's information regarded as knowledge by some expert on the subject.  (More or less.)  What the experts think is important information, and we are not better placed to judge on their subjects than they are.  Third, I don't know why you think there is a need for any kind of &quot;structures&quot; that will somehow &quot;accommodate&quot; both introductory and advanced material (don't we already accommodate it?); maybe I am simply not understanding, though.

I think your argument can be summed up as follows.  Experts arrive at Wikipedia and, unfortunately, they don't want to write about their areas of expertise.  This is (you seem to think) because Wikipedia has a tendency toward conservatism and has a pedagogical mission, which waters down the material and drives the experts away.  To solve this problem, we should perhaps establish some sort of structures that will accommodate the experts, so they'll feel more welcome.

My reply can be summed up as follows.  I am skeptical that there is a problem, and that any such problem is actually caused by what you say it's caused by.

I'm an expert about a few different topics in epistemology and (was, anyway) about aspects of the philosophies of David Hume, Thomas Reid, Descartes, and a number of other philosophers.  I have written rather little about these topics for Wikipedia.  I now ask myself why.  It certainly isn't because I feel somehow put off--that my efforts would not be welcome.  I know they would be perfectly welcome.  I imagine a lot of it has to do with the fact that there is ''so much else to do first.''  How can I write an article about epistemic circularity, for example, when the epistemology area in general is still in very, ''very'' rough shape?

I think maybe a lot of the others, who are experts on various stuff but don't write much about that stuff, feel the same way.  Why write about the specific polymer you're doing experiments about, or about obscure programming methods you've studied, when the basics of your field still need to be filled in and tightened up?

So there's no serious problem here, I think: it's a good thing that we're filling in the basics first.  This gives structure and context to more advanced stuff.

But in a few years, I imagine the basics ''will'' be filled in and tightened up in most fields.  Then it's going to become a lot more interesting for the experts to participate in their capacity as experts--and I predict that they ''will'' participate, too, simply because Wikipedia is fun. --[[Larry Sanger]]

Why do you want to exclude analytical knowledge from an encyclopedia? Isn't math analytical knowledge by your definition? --AxelBoldt
----
It's actually a controversial question whether much of mathematical knowledge is synthetic or analytic (though some of it is certainly analytic if you think anything is--many philosophers deny there's any analytic knowledge).  Kant, for example, thought that &quot;7+5=12&quot; was synthetic a priori.  Anyway, I overgeneralized--obviously, there's quite a bit of analytical knowledge that should be included--but only as an aid to understanding the synthetic knowledge.  It might be better in the end not to try to characterize the sort of knowledge that goes in an encyclopedia as &quot;synthetic,&quot; but the main point of doing that would be to exclude mere dictionary definitions.  This is an arbitrary distinction, perhaps, but I think it's very useful to use dictionaries to find out the meanings of common words, and to use encyclopedias to discover knowledge above and beyond that, including the meanings of jargon. --[[LMS]]

---------
I think that one of the aspects of wikipedia work has to be pleasure taken in writing.  Writing in my area of expertise can occasionally be pleasant because I can tell someone things they don't know which I do.  However, I know lots about lots of areas that are still worth saying, and I don't worry nearly so much about what I'm leaving out as I do about the early middle ages.  Those of us who are teaching faculty all have the same feeling when we are teaching a survey course and need to MOVE ON from the period we are most interested in - we sweat at the thought that the students ''will never know about X if I don't tell them right now!''.  I get more immediate gratification writing for wikipedia than I'm getting out of the article due in October which I'm avoiding working on at this very moment.  The long-term pleasure from the article may be great, but finetuning the argument is driving me nuts.  Hence, I'm thinking about ancient and medieval [[slavery]] instead. --MichaelTinkler

----
Actually, as I understand it, Peter Wozniak feels it is too '''easy''' to change detailed information.
And when he does, being an expert in his field, someone else changes it, who isn't as expert as he, and the
work he put in to make sure the article was technically accurate is lost.
So he spends a lot of time re-creating work because there are only a few days of retention on previous versions,
so he has to come up with the article from scratch, or he has to keep his own copy of the article to fix the problems introduced by non-experts.

:Well.  I watched most of the sleep/learning horror unfold, and I was not impressed with Wozniak's diplomacy. No one's expertise is above question in Wikipedia OR in real life, and he did not accept questions graciously, provide fuller explanations, or show a willingness to discuss what he in his expertise considers settled questions.   --MichaelTinkler
----
Would be nice to know who I'm talking to here.  I suspect you (like Piotr) are relatively new here, and therefore fail to appreciate what actually goes on.  In my daily experience (from the beginning) on Wikipedia, it ''has been'' occasionally true that someone who is inexpert in a subject will edit a part of an article written by an expert, and the result will be a degradation of quality.  But this is fairly rare; and often, the foul is not serious, or is simply debatable.  In point of fact, most people here are reasonably good judges of what they can and cannot credibly write about.  They have the politeness and humility not to pretend to be able to write authoritatively on aspects of subjects that are currently beyond their grasp.  There are exceptions and everyone occasionally overreaches, but these are very able handled by the overall process--it's very robust. 

My understanding of Piotr's case, which to my knowledge hasn't been disputed seriously, is that he insisted on making a page that he wrote reflect only one (of many) views about the purpose of sleep, which is contrary to the NeutralPointOfView.  He was rightly called on this, and in self-defense said that he was the expert and the others, who demanded a more balanced treatment of the subject, shouldn't be able to edit his work.  I think those of us who objected were very right to object, and that Piotr simply failed to understand what's going on here on Wikipedia.  It requires a sort of give-and-take that Piotr, and understandably, many other traditional scholars might not be willing to engage in.  If you or them don't like this, you are encouraged to go to http://www.nupedia.com/ and http://chalkboard.nupedia.com/ .  But don't complain that Wikipedia isn't more closed--it is very open ''on purpose.''  It's what it is ''because'' it's open.  So don't try to make it more closed!

Notice, the reason Wikipedia is so active and successful is precisely ''that'' it is so open.  It's perfectly understandable that there are many experts who cannot work in such an environment--and not just experts, but anyone who simply hates the idea that their work can be edited by any passer-by.  I think most of us have come to the understanding that Wikipedia does not have authors, per se, but contributors--I and many other people as it were take responsibility for the whole thing.  Of course, there are bits of text I care more about (because I know more about them, or because I worked on it).  But I am very comfortable with the fact that the article can take a life of its own.  This is a good thing.  I also think there's ample evidence that the outcome, in the end, will be a lot of really good articles.  Over and over again we see the process resulting in balanced, well-informed discussions of this and that.  Snooty naysayers have fewer reasons to think Wikipedia cannot produce really ''excellent'' content all on its own.

I have been thinking about what Wikipedia will be like in about two or three years.  In that time, nearly all the basics of nearly all subjects will be filled in and explored.  Dilettantes will find nearly nothing to do--only in increasingly specialized areas will there be room to explore.  By then, the encyclopedia will be overrun by open-minded scholars, who look at results rather than degrees, and who love the idea of working together to report on even the most detailed results in their fields.

--[[Larry Sanger]]

----
In science one strives for &quot;operational&quot; definitions: that is, it's meaningless to define words in terms of theories or abstractions--they should be defined in terms of actual physical experiments that one can perform and observe.  For example, the meter--the metric unit of distance--was once defined in terms of a single physical artifact, as the kilogram still is.  When scientific instruments reached the point where it was possible to count wavelegths of a laser beam emitted from a certain apparatus (and it became necessary to have a definition that precise), it was redefined in those terms.  Now it is defined in terms of the speed of light in a vaccuum, because we can now measure that with great accuracy.

An operational definition of &quot;encyclopedia&quot; to me is roughly &quot;Where I go to look up ''basic'' information about some subject that isn't my pet subject, but that I assume somebody more interested has already compiled.&quot;  I go to an encyclopedia when I have a need to know something like &quot;Who was the King of Sweden in 1875?&quot;, &quot;What won the Best Picture Oscar 1945?&quot;, &quot;What's the difference between a donkey and a mule?&quot;. &quot;What is the density of seawater?&quot;, &quot;What other films was that actress I just saw in?&quot;, &quot;How do I convert pounds to kilograms?&quot;, &quot;The news just told me that Justin Wilson died--who was he, anyway?&quot;, &quot;Just where is Bosnia, what kind of people are there, and what language do they speak?&quot;, &quot;What other books were written by this author I just discovered?&quot;

So the primary value of an encyclopedia article for me is ''completeness'' in covering ''basic facts'' about things.  Not necessarily in-depth analysis (though there's certainly no downside to having that as well), but just who did what when.  What is the name, or number, or date I'm looking for?  If I run across interesting details while I'm there, that's cool too, but it's got to have the basics.

Coverage of the natural world should be easy.  A page for every kind of animal, plant, land formation, weather pattern, planet, chemical element, mineral, important compound, form of energy, etc.  History of nations and governments should be easy, as well as important aspects of culture like movies and music--sure, there will be subjective statements in a few of these as well, but as long as the facts are there we have something useful.

Biographies are important, and should be easy.  There have been thousands of people important to someone in varying degrees, and many of them are probably quite controversial in some way.  I don't expect an encyclopedia to make up my mind, but I do expect it to tell me when and where the person lived, what he wrote or spoke about, what he accomplished, who were his friends and enemies, and what the controversies were about, if any.  A picture is always nice.

Abstract concepts are a tricky one: I don't know that I would trust any encyclopedia to give me an unbiased account of what people think of some subject like &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;abortion&quot;, but I ''would'' expect it to tell me that Adam Smith wrote ''Wealth of Nations'', and that ''Roe v. Wade'' was decided in 1973.

A lot of my expectations may be constrained by the history of encyclopedias being paper; for example, I would expect an encyclopedia to have an article on ''The Simpsons'' that told me who produced the show, who starred, when it aired, etc.  But I wouldn't normally expect a separate article about each character.  Maybe here I should, and I certainly don't see any reason not to have that info as well.  I also don't look to an encyclopedia as a source of English usage, but if there are pages about the English language, why not have a complete dictionary, thesaurus, style guide, etc. as ''part'' of this thing &quot;where I look up stuff&quot;?
Maybe that shouldn't be where links go by default, but then I'm not used to &quot;links&quot; at all--they form no part of my expectation, so I suppose they should go wherever the author thinks is useful.  I don't expect things like movie and book reviews, just synopses.  But if a dozen people want to add a review to an article about a movie, why not?

I'm not sure if there's any great insight in any of the above, but at least it's where I'm coming from when I write stuff here, and maybe it's a few good ideas for others to think about when they write here.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Monday, September 10, 2001, 12:38 PM -- One of my hopes for Wikipedia is that it never devolves into [[w:Everything2|Everything2]].  Everything2 might be amusing for some, but we're after something much grander.  People from outside the Everything2 community will hardly ever go to Everything2 to do any research or to learn anything of significance.  Wikipedia is different.  College professors have been sending their colleagues and students to some Wikipedia pages.  C|net includes (or included) Wikipedia results among an encyclopedia meta-search feature.  An article about Wikipedia in MIT's ''Technology Review'' provoked a vague response from Britannica.  Moreover, we're growing by something like 2,000 articles a month and more smart people are arriving each day.

If we want this project to succeed and flourish in a way I am confident it can, I think it's important for us to avoid partisan bickering on [[talk page]]s.  Now, please don't misunderstand my point.  I think there are many appropriate uses for talk pages.  I myself started and encouraged the convention of using talk pages, and I don't at all regret doing so.  (For one thing, it keeps the inevitable non-encyclopedic discussion off the article pages.)

Suppose reporters from some prominent newspapers, library journals, and other influential periodicals were to glance over the RecentChanges page from a given day and write for a worldwide audience:

:Wikipedia is an interesting concept, but it seems to be failing.  Most of its participants, rather than writing articles, are engaged in partisan political debates that have little obvious connection to improving articles.  So, what looked promising for many months has become primarily a debate forum.  Too bad.

None of us would like that, and we're far from being in such a desperate state--but I think there is some small danger of just such a comment becoming appropriate.  Again, not yet--I think most of us do spend most of our time actually working on articles.

It's understandable that people have ended up in verbal fisticuffs here.  We are editing each others' work, and when working on political and other incendiary topics, inevitably, a lot of the edits reflect our personal biases.  Very often, political disagreements are interpreted as personal insults, or attacks on our intelligence, dignity, or honesty.  Male egos in particular can get wounded and concomitant attacks and defensiveness are all too natural.  So, the talk pages are there--and are used to duke it out verbally.

But we ''can'' avoid many of these situations.  We have to bear a few things in mind:
* The basic purpose of the [[talk page]]s is to help improve the article to which the talk page is attached.
* Wikipedia is not a debate forum--that's not what it's ''for.''
* The fact that someone disagrees with you does not mean that (1) the person hates you, (2) the person thinks you're stupid, (3) the person is stupid, (4) the person is evil, etc.  There are many things you can falsely infer from the fact that someone disagrees with you.  It is best not to infer anything at all along those lines, and let that person live with his or her own opinion in peace.
* Before adding a comment to a talk page, ask yourself:
** Is this really necessary?  Why can't I simply edit the article with a summary and leave it at that?  Won't it be obvious what I've done and why?
** Will I actually succeed in changing any minds?  If not, what point does the discussion have, given that the purpose of Wikipedia is to create encyclopedia articles?
** Am I adding this comment simply because I want to defend my ego and advance my own cause?
** If I really ''want'' to continue this debate, is it of general interest, or would it be better to take it to e-mail?
* Efficiency often requires silence.

So let's please, please ''conscientiously'' avoid trying to use Wikipedia as a place where partisan controversies can be settled.

I know I have sometimes fanned the flames myself.  I promise to lead the way on this issue, and, when using talk pages if I must, I'll try my best to focus exclusively on issues that directly concern the articles themselves.  I'll also more often be deleting others' comments that look like [[flamebait]] with zero relevance to improving the article, and I'd encourage others to do the same.

That's my basic point.  Now some objections and replies.

'''What look to you like partisan controversies are usually very useful discussions that result in an improved article.'''

:That is ''sometimes'' the case--but often it isn't.  Debates on such pages as [[abortion/Talk]], [[cultural imperialism/Talk]], and [[sports utility vehicle/Talk]] have very often strayed into discussions that have ''nothing'' to do with improving the article.  That, at the very least, is the sort of thing I'm talking about.

'''The controversy might look irrelevant, but eventually the topic will come back around to something having to do with the article.'''

:Sometimes that does happen, and so much the better.  But why not get right to the relevant topic and skip the intervening wrangling?  Moreover, of course, very often in my experience the discussion ''doesn't'' come back around to anything having to do with the article--it results, instead, in hardened positions.  (As though defending hardened positions had anything to do with writing an encyclopedia!)

'''Well, the talk page controversies get people excited about Wikipedia.  Would you rather that they not be excited?  A controversy-less wiki would be boring.  Maybe the controversy actually brings &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; people to Wikipedia.'''

:The controversies do bring some people back to Wikipedia, perhaps--but it's equally reasonable to say that they also turn off a lot of ''other'' people, the sort of people who don't ''ever'' engage in such controversies.  (Such as most women.)  You should also bear in mind that Wikipedia is extremely exciting quite apart from the controversies--exciting enough all by itself to keep us coming back.

'''But I'm free to do whatever I please here.  This is a wiki, right?  So who are you to tell me what to do, Sanger?'''

:Well, you're ''free,'' yes.  But we do have some community habits and standards, without which the community doesn't work.  Think of it in terms of a human being.  In a sense, you're perfectly free to dance naked on the interstate.  You just have to be willing to live with the consequences.  The consequences are bad enough that we can say that's a bad habit to get into.  Similarly, we are each free to do as we wish as part of the Wikipedia community--but many of us scrupulously avoid certain behaviors because we don't want to live with the consequences, such as opprobrium and contributing to the ruin of the project.

:I know all too well that I can't tell you what to do.  I couldn't control what everyone does here, and I sure as heck wouldn't want to.  Not only would it be exhausting, it would promptly close the whole operation down: Wikipedia thrives precisely ''because'' it is so free and open to everyone.  Hence, I am very cognizant that my best chance of instilling a general community habit, or standard, is by ''persuading'' a lot of people to adopt good habits.  That's why I'm writing this column.

'''A little partisan controversy never hurt anybody.  We all know we're ultimately engaged in building an encyclopedia.  Why try to stop people from doing what comes naturally?  A little controversy won't spoil anything--I don't see what you're concerned about.'''

:Good point, maybe I ''am'' blowing things out of proportion.  Even if Wikipedia would continue to grow and thrive ''with'' the controversy, I think it would be better off without it.  After months of trying to moderate disputes, I can't help but think that we have wasted hundreds of hours, altogether, engaged in pointless debates that we could have avoided with tact, maturity, and attention to the task at hand.  We could have been rather further along than we are now, perhaps with more participants, as well.  If we can start a good anti-partisan-bickering habit now, then, years in the future, I think Wikipedians will thank us for it.

Hear, hear!  Arguing as a means of improving an article is a pale shadow of an equal amount of time engaged in _REASEARCH_.  Yes it may attract people to the project, but it seems logical that these would be people interested in arguing, which, as this essay correctly points out, leads down a dark path we ought not tred.

I think one habit that would be good for folks to get into is to actively seek to summarize discussions, especially those which have elaborated all views on the subject.  This doesn't (necessarily) mean replacing the entire discussion with what *you* think, merely trying to recast the entire discussion as, e.g., a set of bullet points, removing any points that have been taken back or proven incorrect.  If you can restrain yourself to do this in an unbiased fashion (which admittedly is hard), it can result in text which is almost good enough for the main article.

Here are some suggestions for &quot;/Talk Etiquette&quot;:
* Try to say something positive for each complaint you make.  A few compliments can proactively smooth feathers and make the author less likely to simply take offense at the criticism.  A safe approach is to &quot;sandwich&quot; the complaint between compliments, with something positive at the beginning and end of your commentary.  Remember what your mom taught you:  &quot;If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.&quot;  :-)
* Once you are fairly certain the person you're critiquing has seen your complaint (e.g., they've responded to it), be honorable about removing or summarizing it.  Sometimes the author will feel reluctant to remove criticism out of fear it will make them appear afraid of criticism.  You can go even a step further and thank them for addressing (or at least considering) your issue.
* Do not assume that by not complaining, the author &quot;ought to know their work is ok&quot;.  If you like what you read, tell them so.  Typically, people only bother to use /Talk pages when they have an &quot;issue&quot; with the article, thus automatically giving a negative connotation to them, and making it inevitable for arguments to arise on the pages.  Remember that when training an animal (and humans *are* animals), positive reinforcement is vital.  If 9 out of 10 monkeys do what you want, in the long term rewarding the nine can do more than punishing the one.  Isn't there a fable or saying or something about &quot;the carrot is more powerful than the stick&quot;?
* Try posing comments as questions, especially if you're not totally sure.  Instead of saying, &quot;Everyone knows abortion is murder of the innocents,&quot; you could say, &quot;Isn't abortion just murder of the innocents?&quot; and it comes across as less like pure flamebait, as though you're willing to allow for other points of view.
* Limit your statement.  Blanket statements or statements asserting the truth of opinions can inflame the reader, and sometimes if you identify it as your own personal point of view, it can help make it seem less insulting to those who disagree.  For example, instead of saying, &quot;Isn't abortion just murder of the innocents?&quot; it could be better to say, &quot;Certainly I am not the only person who believes abortion is just murder of the innocents?&quot;  In this way, you can still emphasize your strong feelings on the topic, and communicate exactly the same opinion, but do so in a less inflamatory way.
* Acknowledge that you understand the other point of view, by showing yourself able to restate it fairly.  &quot;I understand that you feel a woman's freedom of choice in the matter of abortion is important, but certainly I am not the only one who disagrees with this and thinks that abortion is just murder of the innocents.&quot;
* Help in moderating other people's disagreements, when you come across them.  Same concept as pulling two people engaged in a fist fight apart.  Sometimes just pointing out that the discussion has gotten too heated and that they need to chill out can help a great deal to tone things down and to emphasize that in this community, public verbal sparring is _unacceptable_.  &quot;Hey guys, you're going around and around on this abortion debate; it seems illogical that we could solve this issue here on wikipedia when it's been faught over for years.  Both of you seem to have strong opinions on this matter -- perhaps we should remove this debate and make room for someone with less bias.&quot;
* Finally, avoid writing on topics you are overly passionate about.  The rule here is to write articles neutrally.  It's hard to be unbiased when you're biased.  ;-)

Most of the above suggestions can be summarized very succinctly:  Be Polite.  It's more important (and useful) than you may think.

You have hit the nail on the head, Bryce.  I think that list should be moved somewhere to a policy page. --[[LMS]]

Point taken Larry. I needed to read that. I have definately been guilty of this and it has probably been not too beneficial. Anyway, a suggestion for the Wikipedia Perl gurus: how about altering the codebase so that /Talk pages are dropped off RecentChanges by default (with an option in preferences to put them back in)? that way journalists etc. would have to go looking for the partisan debate, rather than being confronted with it. Just an idea...  -- [[Asa]]

I had similar thoughts regarding dropping /Talk pages, but this might be seen as overreactionary...  -- BryceHarrington

Monday, September 17, 2001, 5:08 PM -- I want to work through a few issues (perhaps relatively trivial issues) that are associated with revising the [[Wikipedia policy]] pages.  This is something that I think would be valuable to do before the ''New York Times'' article appears--having a relatively clear, unified statement of policy seems like a good idea.

One rule I'll have is that I will not try to represent Wikipedians as in agreement about something when they are not.

My main goal in making these changes is to make it clearer and more user-friendly.  I will probably be removing a lot of the conversation that you can see in the present pages.

If you have any questions or comments about what I'm doing, or requests, or whatever, please use this page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Wikimedia Foundation is a nonprofit organization, so &quot;Making Wikipedia Profitable&quot;
should be interpreted as &quot;Making the Wikimedia Foundation a successful self-sustaining longterm nonprofit organization.&quot;  Strictly speaking, monetary profit is not the objective, but at the same time a flourishing and successful organization needs to appropriately balance income and expenses, weighed against the overall mission of the organization.

== Tried, Tested and Tired Methods ==

*Banner advertising -- by universal consensus, this would be entirely unacceptable

*Keyword advertising -- by nearly universal consensus, this would be significantly unacceptable

*Corporate sponsorship not involving direct advertising -- for example, imagine if Google gives us $100,000 in hardware, and we put a link on every page 'benefactors', and when you go to that wiki page, Google is listed along with a quote of why they are sponsoring MediaWiki

*Affiliate programming

*An endowment

== Exciting new 21st Century Methods ==

*branded merchandising - t-shirts are always popular amongst geeks, print up some of the most favourite and oddball pages and sell hundreds.

*micro-payment system - add a small donation button to the top and tail of each page. 

*Wikipedia CD/DVD - wait a while, bring across the majority of the well authored and edited pages to CD/DVD and add in loads and loads of multimedia content; videos, music, pictures. Package it up, sell it for a reasonable price and watch the money roll in! This is probably one of the best ways for Wikipedia to make money in the long run, there are still billions of people without high-speed Internet access (or any at all) and the added advantage of multimedia would even make it a draw for those who can get to the website.

* On [[Special:Booksources]] add a explicit link to a commercial online bookstore (for example Amazon.com), which will pay Wikimedia some kickback (Amazon.de pays 5%). Users who want to can use this link to buy their books there and donate to Wikimedia and the same time. ([http://www.Bookzilla.de Bookzilla.de] is a similar project paying 5% to the Free Software Foundation.)

* Fork the wikipedia.com away from wikipedia.org, and use a template with text merchant links for pages that mention products (books, authors, musicians, games, electronics).  Add a &quot;Flag this&quot; mechanism so that if more than N people flag a page, the ads disappear.  
 
Just as money gained the word 'currency' to indicate the flow of money, we now need to go meta on information to look at the flow of information.

== How about an Experts for Hire page? ==

So-called expert sites like guru.com and exp.com get a cut from the micropayments (think paypal.com) charged by their &quot;volunteer&quot; subject-matter experts.

See [http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/03/technology/03info.html N.Y. Times] article by Lisa Guernsey, February 3, 2000  ''Suddenly, Everybody's an Expert on Everything: Sites Turn Questions and Answers Into a Free-for-All, but Sometimes the Facts Get Trampled'' for an unvarnished look at this idea.

===WikiMobile===

See also under proposed project. Mobile Phones(cellphones) provide a micropayment gateway which could allow wikipedia to generate a lot of revenue from it's existing content. WikiMobile is content organized in a mobile friendly format, WikiMobile by default is offered free to all devices. However data traffic to the site can be white listed, partnering with carriers for a small monthly subscription fee. That would enable users to have &quot;All you can eat&quot; WikiMobile page access. Since Wiki pages are more relevant then random searches on Google this would only prove to be a valuable mobile tool on the go. I personally could get this presented to quite a few mobile carriers in my industry if such a solution was developed.

One other suggestions (perhaps similar to above) is &quot;WikiRequest&quot;, whether through mobile or web users can pledge a certain amount of $$$ to Wikipedia to attract people to research and develop on a requested subject. Lots of ways this suggestion can be explored.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical|2001}}I'm not actually going to start writing this yet.  It just struck me as a great idea for a column--assimilating some issues that were raised in a [http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;amp;threadm=d124e633.0109151411.10bbb29d%40posting.google.com&amp;amp;rnum=1&amp;amp;prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dwikipedia%2Bgroup:sci.physics.relativity%26hl%3Den%26rnum%3D1%26selm%3Dd124e633.0109151411.10bbb29d%2540posting.google.com recent thread in sci.physics.relativity].  The column would answer such questions as:

* Wikipedia doesn't require any sort of credentials for contributors.  Why think it is ''in the least'' reliable?  &quot;You can't really evaluate the validity of something unless you know something about the author and his/her qualifications to speak on the topic and/or you are provided with the appropriate references to support his/her claims.&quot;  That's a common enough attitude--what, do we think that's ''wrong''?  Why?
* Is there anything about the Wikipedia process by itself, unaided by an approval process, that tends to the overall improvement of the reliability of the articles?
* Would it be rational, at some point in the future, to trust what ''any random'' article from Wikipedia says?
* It is possible that ten anonymous people, whose credentials no one knows, to work on a single article.  If such an article is more reliable than an article worked on by, say, just one or two people, why is that?
* Generally, how can recent insights in [[social epistemology]] be applied and/or tested by Wikipedia's experience?
* If I am an expert, and I want the truth stated as accurately as possible, then why on earth should I contribute to a project wherein my words can be edited by all manner of nonexperts who don't even really understand them?  Since nothing's stopping a crank from replacing my brilliant prose with nonsense, what's the point?
* It might be interesting to compare the Wikipedia process with the pragmatic theory of truth--the notion that truth is whatever is considered true within the &quot;ideal limit of inquiry.&quot;  (I think this theory is false, by the way, but the comparison would be interesting.)

I think these questions have very interesting answers, and the questions and answers can be organized in a sort of systematic way that explores the methodological and epistemological underpinnings of why Wikipedia works.  If you want to start discussing this stuff without me, go ahead.  :-)  I guess I'd use any such discussion to help build the essay.

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Yes, I think the Wikipedia process ''can'' result in articles better than those written by single persons no matter how qualified, and for good reason.  Individual humans, even--indeed especially--experts, have egos, biases, and cultural assumptions; but ''groups'' of humans will tend to average those things out.  Very few prople are even capable of seeing all of their prejudices, and need others of different backgrounds to point them out.  That's one reason why humans have things like conferences, so that experts can get together and check each others assumptions.  But this process is even superior to that.  The process here also eliminates the intimidation and control factors of more common human interactions--nobody can be shouted down, and everyone's text looks the same.  Likewise, the time limits of human conferences don't apply.  If you can't think of a good reply to a question in a conference in a few seconds, it doesn't get asked.  Here, it may take days or even weeks, but it does get asked and usually answered.  And the physical limitations of getting like-minded people together don't apply.

You can't get away with evasion here--no assertion goes unquestioned, and no questioner is asked for his &quot;credentials&quot;, as it should be.  &quot;Authority&quot; is nothing but a useful shortcut used in the world of humans because we haven't had the luxury of technology like this that makes expertise less relevant.  What matters is the argument, not the arguers, and this technology supports--indeed enforces--that.  Facts are facts, no matter who writes about them, and even non-experts in a field can tell when an expert is avoiding the facts or pushing bogus arguments.  Should experts then post here?  Absolutely, but only those with the stomach to face the opposition and the backbone to stand behind their case with good arguments.  If they became experts because they got it right, this medium will make them shine.  If they became experts through bluster and bluff, this medium will expose them.  Should I trust a random article?  Certainly not.  But I certainly trust my own bullshit-detection skills, combined with my knowledge of how the process works here, to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.  There will be a lot of chaff, but I fully expect the wheat here to surpass the quality of traditional works for all of the above reasons.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker]]
:I agree with most of this, but think that the chaff here is somewhat an effect of people starting with blank slates. Once basic articles are written, the person who has an english major cleans up the grammar, a philosopher looks at the logic, a specialist in a related field looks at the data and compares it to what he or she knows. Some of the articles I have written contained errors, but over time they have been ruthlessly weeded out by everyone who looked at them and made corrections. Once a framework is in place, it actually becomes easier to improve articles, as the small tidbits of information that I have becomes part of a mass of information from many sources. Can I trust an article here? I think so, but I also need to look at the &lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt; that has gone on, and some of the past revisions to see if the article is brand new, or has been seen by enough &quot;eyeballs&quot;. Research based on information here requires some judgement instead of just blind faith.  -- [[mike dill]]

---
Slightly off-topic, but all that's needed to certify Wikipedia is to test a good
statistical sample of its articles with certified experts.  This would show how closely Wikipedia approaches a conventional encyclopedia.
I'd think a good statistician could correlate
or regress the test data with automatically-collected data, like number of
revisions, number of authors, etc, to test the above hypotheses.
In turn, these facts would then permit the hapless coder(s) supportin WIkipedia to produce a list of articles that probably need attention, and maybe even diagnose what type of attention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wednesday, September 26, 2001, 11:38 AM -- The most meaningful and important thing anyone can do to contribute to Wikipedia is to write a long, accurate, well-referenced, meaty article.

But it's also very important to do &quot;Wikipedia weeding&quot;--particularly when we have disproportionate influxes of new people who are eagerly, willy-nilly, contributing scads of new entries.  We love these people, but they need teaching.  Wikipedia weeding consists essentially of checking over work and making small but important edits and, occasionally, adding comments and questions.  Here, for your edification, is my advice on how to perform Wikipedia weeding yourself.

Here are things I look for (cf. [[w:Wikipedia:most common Wikipedia faux pas]]):
* '''The [[Recent Changes]] page.'''  It's most effective to weed based on what comes up on [[Recent Changes]].  People are looking to see what other people have done to their articles; this is a prime opportunity to teach by example (and teaching by example is that than which nothing is more wiki).  One can also weed by repeatedly following the [[Special:Randompage|Random page]] link and working on whatever comes up.  This latter can be fun!
* '''Look for new names and ISP numbers.'''  It sounds like anti-newbieism, and maybe it is, but very often the people who add the most [[w:dross|dross]] to the project are the newest people.  One of the finest services you can perform is follow these people around and clean up after them.  But, in explaining your changes (if necessary), we do ''not'' want to make them feel unwelcome; please be as gentle as you can with them.
* '''Bad titles.'''  Titles can be improperly capitalized (should be lower case unless the word in the title is always capitalized), and they can be ambiguous.  It can help to tell people to study [[naming conventions]].  If I don't know where a page should be located, I simply append a small italicized note at the end of the page.  If I do know where it should be located, I make a redirection page.
* '''The start of articles.'''  A pet peeve of mine is the tendency to repeat the subject of an article on its own line (it's already at the top of the page) and to make the first sentence of the article a partial sentence.  So I (compulsively, I admit) convert such entries to begin with full sentences, with the subject of the article in &lt;b&gt;bold.&lt;/b&gt;  See [[G. E. Moore]] [ [[en:George Edward Moore]] ] for an example of how this is done.
* '''Articles made to look like dictionary definitions.'''  Another pet peeve of mine are entries that have different senses of the title word numbered--as if we were writing a dictionary (which [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary|we are not]]!!) and we needed to number the senses.  Goddammit, Jed wishes we had parentheses (Magnus, we need to get your software fixed!).  Anyway, I remove the numbers, properly format the separate articles on the page, and put a line between them.  I also, mercilessly, delete any brief appendages to the effect, &quot;In English, this word is also used to mean X,&quot; where the word-in-the-sense-of-X ain't ''ever'' going to be an encyclopedia article.  See [[/Why a list of the senses of a word is not an encyclopedia article]].
* '''Copyediting.'''  It might be unfair and silly, but Wikipedia ''is'' going to be judged based on how well we spell, punctuate, etc.  So I clean articles up that way.  Blatant copyediting mistakes are, even if trivial, nevertheless indefensible; mistakes in content can often be defended on grounds of ambiguity.  So if somebody who cares about how is used spots a bunch of copyediting mistakes, he'll easily be able to conclude the product is shoddy; on the other hand, if the same person sees few such mistakes, and content that is largely correct, with a few overgeneralizations and half-truths, his suspicions of shoddiness will be less certain.  (Just some idle hypothesizing there.)
:: Content before grammar!
* '''Fix bad links.'''  Some newbies, caught up in the excitement (and who can blame them), wikify everything in sight, including plurals, capitalized words that shouldn't be capitalized, ambiguous words and surnames only, etc.  Hence I often make it my mission to fix or remove bad links.
* '''Remove [[patent nonsense]], etc.'''  I sometimes find myself simply deleting entire sentences and even paragraphs.  This has to be done carefully, though, of course.  Sometimes it's just vandalism, and no excuses need to be made to remove ''that.''  Sometimes it's something that seems to have been written by a 14-year-old whose main concern is to express excitement about a hobby, but conveys literally zero information.  The possibilities of useless text, indeed, are endless.  Another possibility is completely, blatantly biased stuff.  If I think I don't have time to correct it, and if the bias is extreme, but the content is useful, I'll move it to a [[talk page]] and say &quot;this needs to be de-biased&quot; or something like that.
* '''Check for and if necessary remove copyrighted stuff.'''  Basically, if some new person (or a person who hasn't [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=editprefs signed in]) writes some fantastic prose, I instantly copy a string of four or five words from it and, in quotes, see if [http://www.google.com Google] recognizes it.  If so (which happens more often than I'm comfortable with), I check on the source page for a copyright notice.  If there is no indication that the text is public domain or released under the GNU FDL, I either remove the text on the spot, giving the URL where I found the text on a talk page, or (if there's some question) I append a note asking where it came from, or whether it's copyrighted, etc.  If I receive no reply, I delete the text.
* '''Light content editing.'''  If, while doing the above, I come across some statement I can make factually correct, or I can add some essential piece of information or remove some clear error, etc., I'll do that.

I probably do this sort of editing more than any other simply because it seems to me that others aren't doing it enough (yet).  It is, again, probably not the ''most'' important way one can use one's time on Wikipedia (there are many ways to help, of course)--but it is definitely essential work.  If we don't do it, Wikipedia is going to start looking more and more like [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Everything2 Everything2], and I swear I'll kill myself if that happens.  :-)

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I ''am'' one of those newbies, but I found myself weeding (carefully) almost at once. I'd like to make a suggestion: If the /Talk page hasn't had any traffic for over a month AND the issue people were talking about has clearly been resolved and fixed, can we delete it? Or does eveyone feel that /Talk pages have significant historical value and should be held onto at all costs? -- [[clasqm]]

: It depends on the circumstances in my opinion. If the /Talk discussion resolved some trivial issue, say a typo, then it can be deleted. But if the /Talk discussion resolved some fundamental questions, then don't delete. In the latter case the 'historical' /Talk may help to avoid that the same discussion arises again. --[[css]]

I remove things from /Talk pages when they aren't relevant anymore. If a change or addition is discussed for a while and then done on the main page, then I think the discussion should be removed as well. --[[Pinkunicorn]]

----
I think I'm counted as a newbie (a week or so, now), and one of the things I've been doing, from the beginning, is this sort of tidying. Not on the &quot;blatant nonsense&quot; level, so far, but fixing spelling, grammar, and such. Then again, how many wikipedia newbies are copyeditors? This is something I find both easy and rewarding, so I do it.
----
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that &quot;newbies&quot; couldn't do a lot of very useful weeding.  Of course they can! --[[LMS]]

Thursday, October 18, 2001, 11:44 PM -- Golly, we seem to be at each other's throats constantly lately.

Can't we cut each other a little bit of slack?  Other people aren't evil because they disagree with us, or because they advocate something that we think would have bad consequences.  They aren't stupid because they make arguments we find completely unconvincing.  They ''are'' all imperfect in various ways, and we shouldn't expect them to be perfect, or even to be particularly good--we should expect them to be average.  But what is average?  Well, especially on Wikipedia (because this is a project made up of volunteers who are smart and generally cooperative), other people are generally nice, reasonable, and sensitive to the concerns of others.

But they sure don't look that way if you approach them with hostility.  They ''can'' look that way if we approach them as a colleague, someone to be respected, a potential friend.  How ''they'' appear very often depends on how ''you'' perceive them--on your prejudices.

There is an art to stepping aside from a situation, and rather than engaging it head-on, asking yourself what engaging in it in ''in a hostile way'' accomplishes--and then, engaging it in a spirit of general helpfulness and goodwill.  Sometimes nonengagement is best--sometimes the best approach is silence--and writing another encyclopedia article!

In the future, Wikipedia could become well-known as a place where collegiality thrives, puzzlingly (or not so puzzlingly), in spite of (or because of) its anarchic nature.  Let us show the world that anarchy (in a positive sense) can exemplify virtues that have never been associated with anarchy, virtues like good humor, friendliness, reasonableness.  That would be great.

These are just idle late-night thoughts, not a careful philosophical essay.  I hope it does a little good.

Let's not forget to cut the perceived hostile ones a little slack, too.  Just because you're offended by something doesn't mean that it's wrong, or that the author is evil or unkind, or that he is personally attacking you.  Different people are offended by all kinds of things, some of which are simple, plain, honest expressions of belief.  For example: &quot;I believe that it is not possible to be a morally good person and to believe in God&quot;.  That will offend a lot of theists, but it is not at all hostile or offensive except in the minds of those who choose to be offended by it.  It is a simple, unadorned, honest expression of belief.  Likewise &quot;That statement is false/nonsense/propaganda&quot; is a simple, honest expression about what its author believes, and the author of the original statement should not take offense, but rather use the knowledge of how someone reacted to his text to improve it.  Practice tolerance as listeners as well as speakers.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

Remember that diplomacy is the virtue of making honesty consistent with politeness.  For elaboration, see a comment I put on [[Lee Daniel Crocker]]. --[[LMS]]

I think if everyone received a stipend from Bomis, there would be less in-house dis-collaboration. Since what is worked on seems so important, people &quot;defend what they cannot see with a killer's pride'' [[Bob Dylan]]. Is Wiki for educational purposes ? If so, what is the problem including copyrighted material under the [[fair use]] provision ? You haven't responded to that yet.
-----
A stipend?!  You must be kidding.  Why don't you just sell your work to the New York Times instead?
----

I've been trying to follow the suggestiion of this page title. I've had some pretty good successes. However, one particular contributor and I aren't getting along &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt; and I'm about ready to go bonkers. Any suggestions?

----

Yes, two suggestions.  First, take a break!  You'll feel better when you come back, and the world won't end.  Second, try e-mailing the other person.  It might be difficult, but it helps. --[[LMS]]

:&lt;i&gt;Thanks! Unfortunately I've just &lt;/i&gt;returned&lt;i&gt; from a short break. :-)&lt;/i&gt;

The problem with including GNU FDL incompatible copyrighted material under the [[fair use]] provision (as [[Everything2]] seems to do excessively) seems to be the lack of a regular way to get the excerpts marked as &quot;invariant sections&quot; under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. --[[Damian Yerrick]]

'''Is Wikipedia an experiment in anarchy?'''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=-1&gt;''Repeating the title here so as to include the question mark.''&lt;/font&gt;

----

November 1, 2001, 11:40 AM -- I maintain that removing a copy of vandalism from someone's personal pages, that that person saved there for the sake of posterity, does not itself constitute vandalism.  Why not?  First, there is no inviolable right to do whatever you want with your personal pages.  ([[Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Crocker]] beat me to the punch on this, having already said it on my own personal page.)  You could not, for example, put copyrighted materials there; you could not slander people there; and it is very arguable indeed that you have no right at all to preserve copies of vandalism, which simply hurts Wikipedia, on your personal pages.  I imagine that if someone were to post essay after essay of hurtful, damaging screeds on their personal pages, that too would have to be removed as well and the perpetrator asked to leave.  I wouldn't like to do this, because I want to make Wikipedia an open place; but we're writing an encyclopedia here, and given that goal, if it becomes necessary, I won't hestitate to do what I think is my duty.

Let me give some background for this thinking.

Why might someone want to preserve vandalism for posterity on personal pages?  I can think of two reasons.

First, one might think no one should ''ever'' delete anything whenever it might smack of censorship, even if what's being deleted is vandalism.  One might want to use Wikipedia as a way to illustrate, highlight, and promote certain political (anarchist) views; and if I (the founder and, let's just say, manager of Wikipedia) removed the pages in question, this is likely to look like censorship to the anarchist.  By moving them to one's personal pages, one requires me, the manager, to come in and delete the pages if I want them deleted.  This then allows one to raise the issue of abridgment of freedom of our personal pages; it's a fairly firm tradition that we allow people broad freedom to do what they want in their personal pages.  So there are two issues here, one concerning censorship and the other concerning freedom.  And I look like quite the big meanie.  :-)

Second, one might think that there is some merit or value to the vandalism itself, or to preserving it.  (On HomePage/Talk, some praised the aesthetic and historic virtues of the vandalism.)  Otherwise, there would be little reason to preserve it on his pages, unless the reasons under the first point were to suffice (which I doubt very much).

For me this allows us to focus on a very important and timely issue: what role does total freedom and openness--to the point of anarchy--play in the Wikipedia project?  I think its purpose is to help build the encyclopedia, no more and no less.  Is Wikipedia an experiment in anarchy?  I don't think so.  Is anarchy of such extreme, perhaps intrinsic, value that we ought to try to preserve it at the cost of other values?  Absolutely not.

Let me try to defend these views.

Our avowed purpose ''is'' to create an encyclopedia, and it is ''not'' to do a lot of ''other'' things that would detract from this purpose.  For example, among the things Wikipedia isn't doing is creating a dictionary and providing a discussion forum for political issues.  The reason Wikipedia exists is to create an encyclopedia.  We have personal pages and there is a commentary page for the purpose of making the writing of an encyclopedia easier, more attractive, and more fun.  Usually, that is precisely how these pages are used.

But Wikipedia is also extremely open: anyone can edit any page.  Those who do not like this aspect of the project (and there are many who do not) can go elsewhere.  Wikipedia has never been an experiment in anarchy ''per se,'' but it has resembled one so closely that it has captured the imagination of quite a few anarchists and libertarians, who have supported Wikipedia's openness with gusto.  This group of Wikipedians has come to treat the openness of Wikipedia as something rather close to anarchy, and any perceived threats to it--particularly from anyone who is regarded as an authority (as distinguished from a rank-and-file member)--immediately become the subject of heated controversy.

There is, it turns out, in a few cases a tension between the goals of anarchy and encyclopedia creation.

Some tensions spring immediately to the minds of the uninitiated, and I don't mean those.  For example, some people would say that anarchy will lead to poor quality and invasion by cranks and vandals.  We've learned that, while there are ''a few'' problems in that direction, the freedom each of us have to edit others' contributions more or less ensures that we'll remove the vast majority of egregiously bad stuff, crank productions, and vandalism.  (See [[Wikipedia/Our Replies to Our Critics]].)

But there are other, more subtle tensions between Wikipedia-the-encyclopedia and Wikipedia-the-anarchic-community to consider.  Here are several (without naming any names--I'm trying to write in the abstract, and I ''do not'' intend to accuse any particular person here):

* Someone might feel inspired to start a project that has considerable intrinsic merit in itself, and might nicely complement an encyclopedia--but for a variety of reasons it would overly complicate work on the encyclopedia, and distract our attention.  If Wikipedia were entirely anarchic, we would permit such projects to be started, no questions asked.  But the focus on writing an encyclopedia is the higher priority, so we avoid such projects, as a rule.
* Someone might want to write a series of inflammatory essays on [[Wikipedia commentary]] or his personal pages that have nothing to do with Wikipedia and its improvement, and which have the effect distracting the attention of the community away from work on an encyclopedia.  Anarchist principles applied to Wikipedia would, I suppose, dictate that such a thing be allowed.  But here, again, I think we should ask such people to write elsewhere, perhaps for [http://www.kuro5hin.org Kuro5hin].
* We all feel inspired from time to time to use [[talk page]]s to express our personal views on a subject, in many cases when in no clear way will this lead to the improvement of an encyclopedia article.  Simply to grease the wheels of production, to make Wikipedia a fun place to be, that seems acceptable, more or less.  But if someone were to get into the habit of using Wikipedia for doing nothing but that, and for stirring up needless controversy, I think we should ask the person to get to work on the articles themselves, or leave.

In these cases, the goal of creating an encyclopedia entails that we disallow certain behaviors that would otherwise be permitted in a state of anarchy.  Upon consideration of cases such as these, I conclude the following.  The ''purpose'' of Wikipedia's anarchism--to the degree to which it is anarchic--is entirely subsumed under the purpose of creating a great encyclopedia.  The remarkable success of the project so far is in very great measure due to this anarchy, or freedom, or openness, or whatever you'd like to call it.  That is undeniable.  But we must make sure that the tail doesn't start wagging the dog here, so that the Wikipedia project becomes as much or more a test of the principles of anarchism as it is an encyclopedia.

How might it become such a test?  Well, perhaps we have been undergoing some such test recently.  I think that one way of interpreting a series of recent controversies is as a test of the respective importance we accord creating an encyclopedia and anarchy.  In particular, in the last month or two a group of self-appointed guardian-guards (&quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot;) have constantly been calling into question quite a bit of what I, Jimbo, and Tim do.  We are given the choice of engaging in a time-consuming, impassioned debate, or simply foisting our will on the unwilling masses.  In the case of someone putting up copies of vandalism on his personal pages, and my removal thereof, several people have lined up on the side of anarchism and freedom and against abuse of authority.  In a way, one has to admire Wikipedia's custodian-custodians and their commitment to their ideals.  But there is, I maintain, a proposition that they either have failed to realize, or that they disagree with: the freedom to put something up on a personal Wikipedia page is entirely subsumed by the goal of creating an encyclopedia.

If, by contrast, we committed 100% to anarchy, so that we were going out of our way to see to it that absolutely nothing that could be construed as &quot;censorship&quot; were permitted, then of course my action would be certainly in the wrong.  But because we are not thus committed, it is perfectly justifiable to remove vandalism from the wiki's pages.

I have one last thing to add.

I need to be granted fairly broad authority ''by the community''--by you, dear reader--if I am going to do my job effectively.  Until fairly recently, I ''was'' granted such authority by Wikipedians.  I was indeed not infrequently called to justify decisions I made, but not constantly and nearly always respectfully and helpfully.  This place in the community did not make me an all-powerful editor who must be obeyed on pain of ousting; but it did make me a leader.  That's what I want, again.  This is my job.

Now if, as I have been recently, I am constantly forced to justify my every action, I can act far less, and my effectiveness as a leader of the project becomes much less effective.  This is precisely what has been happening recently.  Instead of writing this essay, for example, I could have been doing some much-needed weeding on the wiki, designing a Wikipedia-Nupedia interface proposal, or any of a zillion other things I am paid to do.

I trust that those whose priorities are firmly with the encyclopedia can agree that my actions should not be held up to constant, harsh, time-consuming scrutiny against principles of anarchy that are at best subservient to the goal of creating an encyclopedia.

But for those whose priorities lean at least as much to making Wikipedia a test of the principles of anarchy as to making Wikipedia an encyclopedia, I am not sure what to say.  I want you to be involved, and your commitment to openness and freedom is admirable and one that, I hope it is obvious, I share with fervor.  But I ask you please not to try to co-opt my time.  When Wikipedia grows to ten times its present size, if I must deal with ten times the number of the likes of you all, all of my efforts to gently guide this project I've started would be completely undermined.

Larry, I think part of the reason may be that Wikipedia is getting older, and more maturer. When I for instance first started out here, I gave more heed to what you said, since I hadn't learned the ropes yet; now I've been around long enough, I certaintly consider your opinions, but I don't feel as bound to go along with you as I used to. I think that is just historically inevitable. I guess other people around would be the same.

I think with any collaborative project, inevitably participants will a lot of time discussing policy issues. And besides, Wikipedia is a community -- we are writing an encyclopedia, which will always remain our central goal, but so long as we don't loose sight of that goal (and I don't see any signs we are) we should be free to take short diversions now and then. I think that these tangents, and also internal Wikipedia politics, are important for creating a sense of Wikipedia-community, since they constitute shared experiences; and shared experiences are the foundation on which any community is built. -- SJK
----
I am of the opinion, as a user, not as master of all that I survey, that meta-discussion mostly belongs off the wikipedia and in the mailing list or elsewhere.  One of the things that's important is that we don't get involved here on the Wikipedia in excessive navel-gazing.  As we can see from Usenet, people can spend a lifetime arguing without accomplishing anything very useful.  (And don't get me wrong, I love Usenet.)

I would gladly donate space to anyone who wants to preserve some vandalism for the sake of &quot;history&quot;, on a different server.  But Geocities offers free web space already, so that's probably a good place for it. --[[Jimbo Wales]]

:There are some other [[UseModWiki]]s where cruft can be deposited. I found http://www.ourpla.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CreationMatters, http://andstuff.org/AndStuffWiki, and http://www.istori.com/cgi-bin/wiki?KaminskiWiki in a quick [[Google]] search. ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[tbc]]''

Most of the other wikis usually suggest depositing their cruft onto Wikipedia. Don't be so arrogant.
-----
I don't much like Usenet and I think we should avoid both navelgazing, original research, and fiction writing ([[Ova Prima]]!  Please!).  It's hard to quantify, but fiddling with stuff does slow down writing new entries, and edit wars and essay writing are the worst kind of fiddling. --MichaelTinkler
----
Simon, I'm not going to comment on your first paragraph right now--maybe later.

As to the second, I think we have spent ''way'' too much time on Wikipedia politics lately, frankly.  That's one main reason why I wrote this essay.  Experience with multitudinous failed projects and poisoned communities points up the truth of this.  I don't think we have gotten sidetracked by projects so much as by attitudes and personal politics.

As you can see, I share Jimbo's view of navel-gazing. --[[LMS]]

----
But &quot;building a community&quot; is a subsidiary goal as well.  We want to build the kind of community that will produce a good encyclopedia; if that means losing a few folks who don't support that goal, so be it.  I admit that I have a radical individualist political bias here: to me, nothing worthwhile was ever created by a committee.  All the great works of history were the vision of one man or a small group, regardless of how many people were doing the grunt work.  I happen to think Jimbo and Larry's vision of this project is a good one, so I'm happy to be one of the grunts.  But if they sacrifice their control and their vision to some egalitarian nonsense of &quot;community&quot;, they'll fail, and I'll go find some other project that has a clearer vision.  Look at open-source software projects as an example; all of the successful ones (Linux, Perl, etc.) had one man or a small group (Apache, Mozilla) leading the project and clearly setting policy.  Sure, they listened to the community and sometimes changed their minds, but they were still in control, and had a single vision.  So to me, the one &quot;community value&quot; I want most retained is that Jimbo and Larry win.  Period.  And I think that should be more clearly expressed as Wikipedia policy.  Have some balls, guys: you're in charge, don't be afraid to say so.  Anyone who can't handle that isn't part of the community.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker]]

-----

Counter-example to your statement that no great work has ever been created by a committee, Lee: The King James version of the Bible. I'm not even a Christian and I still consider it one of the three most important pieces of literature in the English language.

On the other hand, that's the only example (unless I'm allowed to include the OED and the Britannica too). But it can be done, and it's worth noting that we have a tool unlike any in history at our disposal: Wiki. -- [[Paul Drye]]
----
LDC: What you say about Linux etc. is right, but an encyclopedia is very different from software -- fifty programmers each independently designing and writing a module of a program will produce a program that is very unlikely to work. Fifty authors each writing an encyclopedia article is much more likely to work; human language doesn't need to be as precise and closely integrated as software.

Also, while I'm quite happy with Larry &amp;amp; Jimbo having some sort of leadership role, I don't like the idea of a Wikipedia policy of &quot;...Jimbo and Larry win.  Period...  Have some balls, guys: you're in charge, don't be afraid to say so.  Anyone who can't handle that isn't part of the community.&quot; They have a special status of leadership, but I'd view it more as primus inter pares (first among equals) than as some kind of authority to tell us what to do. (Jimbo has a special kind of authority insofar as its  his server and domain name we are using, but that isn't quite what I am talking about.) -- SJK
----
I'm a bit uncomfortable with Lee's characterization, too, but I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with it now than I would have several months ago.  Here's a way to think about what &quot;first among equals&quot; means.  Typically, controversies are left to work themselves out by the people who care.  But when push comes to shove, if a decision must be made and there's a serious controversy, and I'm partaking of it, sorry, but I'm going to get my way.  And you'll be expected to hold your tongue after that.  Bear in mind that I am going to listen to you, I have the best interests of Wikipedia at heart, and I am almost never going to contradict a majority. --[[LMS]]
----
LMS: I recognize that might be how things will work in practice, but I don't like the idea of it being mentioned officially; it just goes against my egalatarian and democratic bent to grant anyone an official &quot;last word&quot;, no matter how deserving they might be of it. And I think we need some checks and balances -- you may think you can be trusted to use your powers wisely, but not everyone may be so sure. (I'm not saying you can't be trusted -- I'm simply saying no single individual can be absolutely trusted.) I might feel a lot more comfortable if your position in relation to Wikipedia was subject to some sort of election. (I don't expect anyone other than you would win, but one would be important nonetheless, for reasons of democratic legitimacy.) -- [[SJK]] (P.S. sorry if I misinterpreted your position re Wikipedia-L).

The ultimate check-and-balance is the threat of a fork.  If Jimbo and/or Larry get entirely out of hand, anyone is free to take the GFDL-licensed content of Wikipedia and start another project (with appropriate link-backs to the source until such articles are rewritten).  Until then, leaving the ultimate decisions for ''this'' project in one or two people is entirely appropriate.  Server space is pretty cheap.

I do, by the way, concede your points that the KJV Bible is a marvellous work by committee, and that an encyclopedia project is inherently more distributable than a piece of software.  The &quot;vision&quot; of the KJV, though, was already constrained by the nature of the project, so it would have been difficult for too many differences to arise there.  It wasn't really a &quot;creative&quot; work at all.  I suspect, further, that anyone who had a major disagreement with the King himself quickly found himself off the committee. :-)  --LDC

----
Simon, I am ''paid'' to ''organize'' Wikipedia, and I founded the project.  So I hereby declare that I am dictator for life, until Jimbo fires me.  :-)

This isn't an issue about who's right and who's wrong.  It's an issue about who makes the decisions and how long I ought to engage in a debate in order to justify a controversial decision.  You can, theoretically, debate points ad nauseam I've given up discussing.  This is basically how I've approached the [[NPOV]] debates. --[[LMS]]
----
LDC: Yes, I agree that forking is an ultimate check and balance, supposing Larry and Jimbo did go haywire (not implying for a moment that they are likely to), but shouldn't we permit something less drastic than that? Saying we should have forking as the only alternative is like saying that revolution or emmigration should be the only solutions to misrule?

In the real world, the reason we have democratic means for removing people in charge is to stop any damage they might do to the community without the cost of revolution. Supposing Jimbo/Larry did go haywire, the negative effect on Wikipedia would be much less if they were voted out than if the project forked. (Of course, since Jimbo owns the servers he could just ignore the vote, but at least it might serve as some sort of 'official censure'; i.e. it would be more likely that people would accept it than if some faction just decided for forking...) -- SJK

:I think this suggestion is far more trouble than it's worth.  If we screw up too badly, there's all sorts of things people can do to raise hell.  Just act like TheCunctator, for instance. --LMS
----

Larry, you are paid to do a job here.  So do it.  If vandalism is a problem, get rid of it.  When there is a clear troublemaker wasting your time and Jimbo's money, block them.  Not every is going to like that, but ya know, not everyone likes you here anyway.  I am not sure I like you :) So whats the difference?  Why lose any more sleep over it?  Do what you're paid to do so that the rest of us can enjoy this place.   And if it forks, whoopdedoo.  Good luck to them.  You do what you are paid to do here, which includes laying down the law from time to time, and wikipedia will continue to thrive.  In closing, let me remind you that &quot;work is work&quot;, and sometimes its just that.  Not always fun.  
----
Thanks for that firm support, I think!

For the record, I'm not sure I like you either--since you're anonymous.  :-) --[[LMS]]

:heh...  it is firm support.  You are doing pretty darn good job overall.  And you probably don't like me very much, because I pick on you sometimes.  =)


----
LMS said: &quot;If push come to shove, ''I'm going to get my way. And you'll be expected to hold your tongue.''&quot;  

I have no problem with the first part (provided we can fork the project if things get really out of hand), but I think the second part makes no sense.  Look, I've been the leader of several volunteer based organizations, and my experience is that leaders are criticized, leaders are vulcanized, and leaders have to take shit the grunt's don't have to. From my perspective, that's just what is to be expected since they actions of leaders affect lots of people important ways.  If you want to be a leader, you are going to have to deal with people calling you a dick, and even making up egregious lies about you.  You don't have to like it, but you can't stop it, and you shouldn't even try, because you?ll only make things worse.  That said, I think lots of people should cut you and Jimbo some slack, you are both clearly trying to do the &quot;right thing&quot; and for that you deserve congratulations. 

I'd also like to ask some folks who support Jimbo and Larry to deal appropriately with attacks against them.

As far as elections are concerned -- come on now, this is a commercial project run by a company owned by Jimbo.  Perhaps it would be better if it were a non-profit, but it is what it is, and nobody elects the owner of the company, and no election dictates how he should spend his money or even how he should delegate his authority.  Even if elections were held, we'd all know that at bottom they don't really mean anything, as Bomis pays the darned bills.

:I should have clarified, if I didn't, what I meant by &quot;hold your tongue.&quot;  I didn't mean that you'd be kicked off the project (somehow) if you didn't.  I meant that that behavior would be more or less generally expected, a community norm that most people would respect.  Short of kicking people out for speaking their mind, which I don't propose (my comments in the essay notwithstanding), this is all I could have reasonably meant by that. --[[LMS]]
----
Who are these people who you say are attacking Jimbo or Larry? I hope you don't mean me, because I'm not, and I don't intend to. Larry and Jimbo have done a wonderful job with Wikipedia, which doubtless wouldn't exist without them. However, they don't own Wikipedia (for one thing, the vast majority of the content was written by other people). Which is why I still think some form of election or something would be useful.

Is this a commercial project run by Jimbo/Bomis? I don't really think so -- sure, they might make some money out of it eventually, and good luck to them, but I don't believe that at the moment they are earning a cent. I suspect that wanting Wikipedia/Nupedia to succeed in itself, even if they don't make money out of it, is at least as important. 

And I'd myself admit that since Bomis pays the bills, ultimately they are in control (unless one can find someone else willing to pay for them...) But that doesn't mean elections are useless. 

Elections give moral authority to the one elected. And since I'm not proposing we elect anyone other than Larry or Larry/Jimbo, they would add to their authority, not decrease it. The other point is that it would make some people (e.g. me) more happy with the idea of them exercising some kind of authority if they were elected. (Finally, I'm getting sick of that word -- authority! -- it just sounds so ugly.) -- SJK
----
Simon, we aren't going to have an election.  What would happen if someone other than me were elected?  Would I lose my job?  Look, neither Jimbo or I would support it.  So forget it.  Besides, since I have already appointed myself dictator-for-life, it would be a mockery of elections.  If you want to give me a vote of confidence, write an article.  If you want to express the opposite sentiment, raise hell. --[[LMS]]

LMS wrote:
:I think this suggestion [being able to vote out LMS] is far more trouble than it's worth.  If we screw up too badly, there's all sorts of things people can do to raise hell.  Just act like TheCunctator, for instance.
I may have raised a little hell, but I've been trying to do a lot more constructive work (like [[The Cunctator/How to build Wikipedia]], [[The Wikipedia Community]], [[GNU Free Documentation License]], comments on mailing lists, and my continued editing work--look how defensive I am!). And for those who think that discussion is stoopid (like MichaelTinkler) I have no defense, but I actually think that it's better to discuss issues when they're young than when they're out of hand or utterly done deals.

And it should be noted that LMS has requested that I delete the Destroy article, so he feels that the raising of hell should not necessarily be preserved.

I disagree strongly with Jimbo that the Wikipedia interface is inappropriate for meta-discussion, and I'm glad that Larry disagrees (at least in action; his essays are great). One of the great things about Wikipedia is that it's naturally inclusive; mailing lists are naturally exclusive. In fact, I'm thinking of working on ways to better integrate the mailing list with Wikipedia, so that we may be able to get the best of both worlds. 

In regards to the essay; I think Larry has a bad habit of resorting to rhetorical sloppiness, using loaded terms like &quot;anarchy&quot; and &quot;partisan&quot; to paint the actions of others with a wide brush. Wikipedia ''had'' been an experiment in limited anarchism, in regards to Larry's original conception of his role (see [[Simon J Kissane/Role of Larry Sanger]]). I had been operating under the assumption that was how he still saw his role. Now that change has been clarified, and Wikipedia is an experiment in some other system.

It seems that the title is a deliberate rewording of a phrase I used on Destroy and Build: &quot;Wikipedia is a noble attempt at a limited anarchistic society&quot;. People, including Larry and Gareth Owen, have construed this to call me an anarchist. I'm not. I think anarchism is too idealized to work in the real world, though I appreciate the basic principles of anarchism (see [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html this definition]--an anarcho-capitalist has dominated the Wikipedian pages). 

As I discuss this, it may make it seem like I have a strong antipathy toward LMS and Jimbo; rather, I have a deep respect for them. They're both intelligent, principled, and idealistic. My criticisms are not criticisms of them or their motives but simply of certain actions or consequences of such actions. --TheCunctator

:I started to reply to this, but halfway through realized that it was pretty self-evidently a series of [[Logical fallacy/Non sequitur|nonsequiturs]], [[ignoratio elenchi]]s, misattributions and misunderstandings, and other problems.  Correcting all this is precisely the sort of thing that I don't have time for. --[[LMS]]

I guess it does take less time to just call me an anarchist, write a few vague dismissive comments, and delete content because you don't like it. It would be interesting if you ever bothered to back up your attacks (&quot;nonsequiturs, ignoratio elenchis, misattributions and misunderstandings, and other problems&quot;) with specifics. --TheCunctator
----
:''In the case of someone putting up copies of vandalism on his personal pages, and my removal thereof, the usual suspects have lined up on the side of anarchism and freedom and against abuse of authority.''

I utterly reject your assertion that I am one of the &quot;usual suspects&quot; who defends anarchy, and who constantly calls your actions into question. I strongly believe that a project like Wikipedia needs a leader who keeps things running and makes the final decision on important matters, and you, Mr. Sanger, are that leader. So let's not make false characterisations here.

In this particular case, I simply questioned the wisdom of deleting content on a personal page without any discussion. Let me be clear on this: I ''do not'' hold the position that personal pages are the property of their creators and are completely off-limits to editing. If someone starts throwing up copyrighted material, or starts posting essays on why every other person on Wikipedia is an idiot, I have no problem with removing that material. If the person doesn't like it, he can get his own server; we're making an encyclopedia here. The material that you deleted didn't fall into that extreme a catagory (although I do believe that it serves no useful purpose, and is very likely harmful); a simple request to remove it, along with the reasons why, should have been given directly to the poster before removing it by force.

More generally, you run the show. That's your job, and I'm glad that you've come to realize your position (as opposed to your &quot;I'm just an ordinary Wikipedian&quot; view a month or two ago). Make no mistake, without you (or someone capable and empowered to do your job), Wikipedia would fall flat on its face. As leader, you can't brush off issues you ''personally'' don't consider important with the excuse that you have real work to do. You have to herd the cats, and since we're a pretty diverse bunch of felines, it's not an easy job. Of course, you also have to pick your battles. I encourage you to pick the issue of personal page deletion as one of those battles. My suggestion is that we draw up some guidelines for personal pages; nothing elaborate, but something along the lines of your page isn't yours in an absolute sense, no copyrighted material, blah blah blah. You, of course, have the final word (so to speak) on what violates these guidelines. --[[STG]]

Thanks, and I am sorry for the &quot;usual suspects&quot; remark. --[[LMS]]

----
Larry, I will support you in making decisions for Wikipedia.  A project must have leadership. Because the content is under the GFDL, we have no need to fear your abusing it. The GFDL is the contract between you and us, and that guarantees the ultimate freedom of the information, and that's what matters to me. --[[Dmerrill]]
----
Who cares whether wikipedia is anarchic or not? The goal of the folks running the server is to create a great encyclopedia. The method is to let anyone, even an amateur like me, contribute.

The &quot;vandalism&quot; issue is best resolved by reference to the goal (great encyclopedia) and the standard (neutral point of view). I cannot recall even a single case of an IDEA being excluded, only that its presentation conform to NPOV. My own ideas have often been shot down for being wrong, imprecise, shoddily presented, etc., but I have managed to wedge nearly all of them in anyway, by conforming to the goal and the standard. At first my edits were called vandalism so frequently that I suspected others of unfairness, but now that I (mostly) have learned the ropes, I've become a respected contributor. Or else I've grown awfully thick skin! --Ed Poor

''Deleted from main page and misattributed to [[24's contributions|24]]''

Saturday, November 3, 2001, 2:41 AM --  I am nearly as much a fan of openness, freedom, and even of anarchy as anyone.  But not at the expense of our focus on working on encyclopedia articles on the website.  I don't want to stop anyone from talking, and if I can find a way to let them talk freely without interfering with our mission, that would be grand.  I have been getting increasingly frustrated at the way we have been, daily, sidetracked by this issue or that issue, raised by a commentary page essay or a personal page essay, when, on the wiki, we should be building an encyclopedia.  This has seemed to be a serious conundrum for me, particularly projected into the future.  Suppose the daily editors increase tenfold; I simply could not do any work if I wanted to do justice to most of the various commentary that seems to demand some reply from me.

When I first read the following from Jimbo, I guess I didn't quite understand why he might say it:

:I am of the opinion, as a user, not as master of all that I survey, that meta-discussion mostly belongs off the wikipedia and in the mailing list or elsewhere. One of the things that's important is that we don't get involved here on the Wikipedia in excessive navel-gazing. As we can see from Usenet, people can spend a lifetime arguing without accomplishing anything very useful. (And don't get me wrong, I love Usenet.) 
:I would gladly donate space to anyone who wants to preserve some vandalism for the sake of &quot;history&quot;, on a different server. But Geocities offers free web space already, so that's probably a good place for it. --Jimbo Wales

I agree with this completely.  I would have no problem with someone including a complete history of Wikipedia vandalism on an alternate Wikipedia commentary wiki.  So that's indeed what I propose.  I propose that we all move all the [[Wikipedia commentary]] pages, as well as all of our personal essays (and archives), to a completely separate wiki.  I would be only too happy to move my own essays, listed on [[Larry Sanger/Columns]], to that wiki and to delete them forever from this wiki.

(You know, I started both the [[Wikipedia commentary]] page and the practice of writing regular essays on Wikipedia policy.  So I am forced to admit that these are, really, my own mistakes.)

There are several clear advantages that this would have over the present system:
* This would allow us to focus on ''encyclopedic content'' on Wikipedia.com.  That's something I dare say nearly everyone could cheer about.
* Correspondingly, those of us (including Jimbo and I) who do not want to engage in endless navel gazing, but who do want to work on encyclopedia articles, can let the navel gazing proceed unmolested.  This is going to be particularly important in the future.  If Wikipedia grows the way I think it will, talking about Wikipedia is going to become a full-time occupation for some people.  We can't let that stand in the way of the growth of the reason we're all here--the encyclopedia.
* Also correspondingly, Wikipedia would become not only a more focused but also a more ''pleasant'' and ''courteous'' place, since in my experience, people don't get quite as worked up over articles the way they do over commentary.  Sure, there are still nasty debates, but not like the sort we've seen recently.
* I would have no motivation whatever to remove vandalism archives from a Wikipedia commentary wiki, or for that matter, any other sort of critique (short of plain old slander, I suppose).
* I would have no motivation to remove subpages from a commentary wiki.

You might object that such a wiki would make it more difficult to discuss perfectly legitimate policy matters that ought to be subject to some public discussion.  My reply:
* For many months we did not use [[Wikipedia commentary]] or personal essays very much, or at all, to discuss Wikipedia policy; these are relatively new developments.  Instead, we developed policy together, more or less, right there on the policy pages, and things worked out reasonably well.  I and sometimes others would refactor the pages from time to time; but it was generally understood that we weren't engaged in debate and soapbox preaching, but more or less in collaborative writing.  An example of this is found on [[naming conventions]]; nearly all the policy pages have been carefully refactored by me to reflect my understanding of community consensus and simply what I found on the pages.  A recent example of this (that was actually started on [[Wikipedia commentary]]) is called [[the Wikipedia Community]].
* Moreover, if someone were feeling particularly long-winded, he or she could always post something like an essay on the mailing list.  This is something that people have been doing for quite a while as well.
* Finally, of course, policy discussion could still be conducted on the commentary wiki!

Another possible objection is that this would be an abridgment of our freedom to use personal pages as we wish.  But hitherto we have been free to do what we want to with our personal pages just because we ''made'' that the law of the &quot;land.&quot;  We can change laws, and this change makes good sense, given our goals.  The Wikipedia website should be devoted to writing an encyclopedia and simply codifying policy.  It will help greatly if Wikipedia is ''not'' also, in addition, a place where people can co-opt the attention of other participants with long acrimonious debates over policy or their personal opinions as expressed in essays.

Basically, I think we should go back to using personal pages on Wikipedia.com in the way they were originally used: to introduce ourselves to the community and to exchange public messages.

So, that's the proposal.

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
I am fully in support of this larry. I have adopted the way it is now, but I have always kind of felt that people from the outside (who we are ostensibly writing this for, as much as ourselves) shouldn't be subjected to non-encyclopaediac information in their encyclopedia. It worked good for us, but its certainly not scalable and will get in the way when wikipedia gets a lot bigger.

--[[Alan D]]
:Scalability is certainly one of my biggest concerns.  I think we should make a clear distinction between ''meta-level discussion'' and the encyclopedia. --[[LMS]]
-----
I think the cleanest approach would be to have a meta.wikipedia.com wiki (or a namespace) to which we unload everything now on wikipedia.com which is does not belong into an encyclopedia proper:
* commentary essays
* personal introductory pages, Wikipedians
* rule discussion
* How to behave/how not to behave on wikipedia
* How to edit pages 
* Why Wikipedia is so great
* Announcements
The Wikipedia would then only contain one article about Wikipedia explaining the project, with a link to meta.wikipedia.com. Furthermore, the main page would contain a link there as well.

Essentially, the material on wikipedia.com could be sold as an encyclopedia; if you want to know more about the contributors, the project or how to contribute, you'll have to go to the meta wiki. --AxelBoldt

:I didn't state my proposal clearly enough.  :-(

:I actually would prefer to have all the &quot;official&quot; policy and propaganda pages as well as one-page member pages (i.e., without subpages) on the main wiki, but in different namespaces.  The policy pages would be in the &quot;Wikipedia:&quot; (w:) namespace, the talk pages would be in the &quot;Talk:&quot; (t:) namespace, and personal pages would be in the &quot;User:&quot; (u:) namespace.  The contents of the present commentary section and all personal essays that are subpages of personal pages are, I'm proposing, what we should put in an entirely different wiki.

:We need to make it as easy as possible for new people to learn about what's going on here, and to attract them to the project--thus the necessity of having the &quot;official&quot; policy and propaganda pages as easily accessible to and part of the main wiki.

:Putting the navel-gazing on a separate wiki altogether would be an appropriate prioritization.  We're not here to talk about writing an encyclopedia.  We're here to write an encyclopedia. --[[LMS]]
----
I can't imagine how things would be different, unless people would act differently there or rules are differently defined. What if someone puts something on their personal pages which a Wikipedia principal doesn't like? Will they delete it? Will they edit it and demand that their edit remains unchanged? Will they just ignore it?

I can only imagine something substantively different, like banning all commentary whatsoever outside of the mailing list, and banning access to the official entry about Wikipedia to all but the principals or a few trusted souls, would bring substantive change.
--TheCunctator

My thought: assuming appropriate changes to the wiki
software, there should not ''be'' personal pages in the
main wikipedia.  Name entries in [[Recent_Changes]] would
point to the proper place in the meta-wikipedia, and it
won't matter if free links don't point to user pages if
discussions aren't taking place within Wikipedia.  

Improper usage of personal pages becomes a non-issue.  
&lt;nowiki&gt;/Talk&lt;/nowiki&gt;
pages, purely for the development of the article, might
need some thought.  --[[Alan Millar]]

:Right.  So, we're going to be moving personal pages to a &quot;user:&quot; namespace.  See [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/wiki.phtml] to get an idea of how this will work.  Changes to all namespaces will, as it's presently written, indeed be recorded in [[Recent Changes]].  I just think we need an entirely separate [[Recent Changes]] page for meta-discussion. --[[LMS]]
----
When we switch to the new wiki software, we would have a separate namespace for meta-discussion. Would this not serve the same purpose as a separate wiki? --[[STG]]

I agree with Jimbo's reasoning, and I wonder the same thing as STG. Alternatively, someone could dedicate a UseModWiki server to this objective right now. ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[tbc]]''

:STG: not really, because changes to a &quot;discussion&quot; namespace would be recorded in [[Recent Changes]].  On the other hand, if each namespace had its own changelog, that might be OK.  I'd actually prefer a separate wiki, though.  We want a clear distinction between the encyclopedia project and meta-discussion thereof. --[[LMS]]
::Ok, I see what you're saying. In that case, I agree with you, as long as the official policy pages are developed by the community (as they are now), and links to relevant discussions on the separate wiki would be permitted. I would like to keep subpages off of personal pages, though, just not for essays on Wikipedia policy. But, since there's not much to do with encyclopedia projects on my own subpages, I don't have a particularly strong argument, other than it's doesn't hurt anything. --[[STG]]

:I don't think it's brushing matters under the carpet, and it's not banning commentary either.  It's just moving it to a place clearly separated from the main action.  This is a good thing, not a bad thing, because we ''want'' to focus attention on the encyclopedia as opposed to discussion thereof. --[[LMS]]

Why would it be any harder to click on another website to check out the dialogue? This is still in public, it would simply be a lot easier to provide a proper forum for discussion. I think another site (Namespace or Wiki) is a very good idea. Also, people should really be able to post what they like on the new site without it being changed, as there would be no need for this to happen. I might even be able to get a proper personal-page then ;-) -- [[sodiumtheperson|sodium]]

Exactly.  BTW, you'll be able to take &quot;sodium&quot; on the new wiki.  It will be user:sodium (or u:sodium). --LMS
----
I think it is important to avoid mixing encyclopedia articles with other stuff. If an alternate wiki or namespace (I prefer the namespace) exists for personal/meta/experimental/controversial stuff, the encyclopedia proper can be kept much cleaner without introducing censorship. (I'm implicitly assuming that moving stuff in another, publicly accessible location does not constitute censorship.) I think almost everyone is able to get a feeling of what is deemed acceptable as an encyclopedia article just by looking at what is already there. They should try to conform to that. The /talk subpages should stay but their goal should be limited to ideas for improving the contents of the article under discussion.

The measure Larry proposes would be beneficial for the contributors who aren't interested in meta-discussion or opinions, as they could choose whether or not to learn about what's happening there. It would benefit those who ''are'' interested in such matters, as they could express themselves and collaborate using the wiki format (which I personally think is far superior to mailing lists). Linking from &quot;alternate space&quot; into the Wikipedia wouldn't pose a problem. However, there is the question of linking ''from'' the Wikipedia ''towards'' &quot;alternate space&quot;. I'm not sure exactly in what situations that would be appropriate. I think there should exist links to contributor's pages in review histories and recent changes. Other than that, I don't know. It might become necessary in some talk subpages. --[[Seb]]

Well said.  And indeed we should think a bit about policies re: linking from the main wiki to the meta-discussion wiki.  The whole effect would be lost if we started linking the too closely. --[[LMS]]
----
Would the &quot;talk&quot; namespace (that will be used anyway) be sufficient, or should I create a &quot;commentary&quot; namespace for that? --[[Magnus Manske]]

Let's wait to see how this discussion pans out first, Magnus.  I think we'll probably just be setting up a different wiki altogether.  (And it could use subpages!  :-) ) --[[LMS]]
----
While we're at it, I think an &quot;original work&quot; or &quot;research&quot; namespace for those of us who are interested in ''creating'' or discovering new knowledge collaboratively (while preserving the &quot;serious&quot; aspect that is so valuable in Wikipedia) using the wiki interface, would be a great thing to have. Basically the only commitment there would be to a neutral point of view. Whether or not an idea/conjecture/result is new would not be a criterion for inclusion/exclusion - in fact idiosyncracy would be encouraged there. -- [[Seb]]

Ugh.  Not a different namespace--a different wiki altogether, with no official association with Wikipedia.  Jimbo will happily set up such a wiki for you. --[[LMS]]
:Hmm...are you implying that I'm the only research-driven person who hangs out around here? --[[Seb]]
::Certainly not (take me, for example). It's just that your proposal doesn't really fit with an encyclopedia, and would be better served as a completely separate project. --[[STG]]

Frankly, if people want to set themselves up as editorial staff on a meta-discussion wiki, and they don't do a bad job, they'd be free to do that, as far as I'm concerned.  As long as they leave the main wiki free to thrive, I'll be happy.

Indeed, new people ''don't'' need to know of the existence of discussion pages in order to get stuff done.  They ''do'' need to see the policy pages, which is why I think they shouldn't be moved to the meta-discussion wiki (mdw).  We can have prominent links to the mdw from the front page and from the FAQ and other documents, though. --[[LMS]]
----My first thought is &quot;yes, please, move all content to some other place where I don't have to see it.&quot;  :-)  My second thought is &quot;but for us to reach consensus about how to present an article, often we'll have to discuss aspects of the article, and to have that discussion, since this ''is'' the web, it makes sens to leave links to the page where the discussion will take place.  So my question is, will the links to Talk &lt;nowiki&gt;pages/namespaces/whatever&lt;/nowiki&gt; be an option that has to be turned on in preferences, so that it has ''some'' use?  Otherwise, how would it actually be any different?  (Newbies come in, they see something interesting &amp;amp; different, then they see a lot of bickering and idle chitchat, then they go on to espn.com).  I must be missing something (as I often do).... --[[KQ]]

Well, it's not part of the proposal that we move ''talk'' pages (see [[talk page]]) to the mdw.  The stuff that I want moved, so we don't have to see it :-) unless I want to (as I'm sure I will--occasionally) are in two broad categories: the essays on [[Wikipedia commentary]] and personal essays such as those linked to from [[Larry Sanger/Columns]]. --[[LMS]]
----
Sounds good.  Do it.
----
It sounds like there's quite a bit of support for the general idea.

I am going to start a discussion on [[Wikipedia-L]] on exactly how to do this.  Please join or look at the archives soon to see the proposal; join the list to discuss it. --[[LMS]]4</text>

The purpose of the '''Wiki(pedia) Machine Translation Project''' is to develop ideas, methods and tools that can help translate Wikipedia articles (and [[Wikimedia]] pages) from one language to another, particularly out of English and into languages with small numbers of fluent speakers.

Remember to read the current [[talk:Wikipedia Machine Translation Project|talk page]] and particularly what is stated it the Wikipedia Translation page:

[[Wikipedia]] is a [[Wikipedia:Multilingual coordination|multilingual project]]. Articles on the same subject in different languages can be edited independently; they do not have to be translations of one another or correspond closely in form, style or content.  Still, translation is often useful to spread information between articles in different languages.

Translation takes work.  Machine translation, especially between unrelated languages (e.g. English and Japanese), produces very low quality results.  Wikipedia consensus is that '''an unedited machine translation, left as a Wikipedia article, is worse than nothing.''' (see for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_44#Other_Wikis here]). The translation templates have links to machine translations built in automatically, so all readers should be able to access machine translations easily.

Remember that if the idea would be to simply run a Wikipedia article in a fully-automatic machine translation system (such as Google Translate), there would be no point in adding the results to the &quot;foreign&quot; Wikipedia: a user should just feed the system with the desired URL.

== Motivation ==

Small languages can't produce articles as fast as Wikimedia projects in languages such as English, Japanese, German or Spanish, because the number of wikipedians is too low and some prefer to contribute to bigger projects. One potential solution for this problem, in discussion since 2002, is the translation of Wikimedia projects. As some languages will not have enough translators, Machine Translation can improve the productivity of the community. This sort of automatic translation would be a first step for manual translations to be added and corrected later, while the local communities develop.

A second, but very important motivation, is the development of free tools for Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. These fields are very important, but resources for small languages are usually inexistent, low-quality, expensive and/or restricted in their usage. Even for &quot;big&quot; languages such as English, free resources are still short. We could develop...

== Approaches ==

=== Interlingua approach ===
A different, but related approach would be translating articles into a machine translation interlingua like [[w:Universal Networking Language|UNL]], then writing software modules to translate automatically from that interlingua into each target language. The initial translation could be created fully by hand, or machine translated with humans verifying accuracy of the translation and choosing between multiple alternatives. This only saves work with respect to direct translation if there are several target languages whose modules are well enough developed, but those modules are much easier to write, and expectably more accurate, than full real-language to real-language automatic translation systems.

=== Translating between closely related languages ===

I would imagine it would be an easier task to translate between similar languages than non-similar ones. For example, we have Wikipedias in Catalan and Spanish and Macedonian and Bulgarian, perhaps even Dutch and Afrikaans (some more studies would have to be done to evaluate which would be most appropriate). There is some free software being produced in Spain called [[:en:Apertium]] that might be useful here.

=== Suggested statistical approach ===

* In a first step, a series of language corpora and statistical models are generated from the various Wikipedias. The results are particularly interesting because, besides the extraction of text needed for the project, they also allow us to make public under a permissive license a kind of data generally unavailable for smaller languages, or at most only available after expensive purchases. Many of these have already been released and are hosted at SourceForge:

* As most of the minor Wikipedias would likely be populated, at least at first, by articles in the English one, the first pairs to be developed would be the English/Foreign language ones. Thus, for each language an initial list of random sentences is drawn from the English corpus (as above) and, if such a system is available, translated with some existing machine translation software (such as Google Translate or Apertium). Hopefully, wikipedians will start revising the translations collaboratively, just like the normal Wikipedia articles.

* After the small list of random sentences is adequately translated/revised, a number of other sentences will be selected to be gradually added to the developing parallel corpus. By using statistics collected with the language models built above, particularly with the English one, two different approaches will be followed:
** The first is to gradually cover all common n-grams of all orders (descending from 5-grams), so that the most common structures in the English wikipedia will be covered by the corpus (in other words, more pages should be translated with fewer problems -- think about very similar pages such as the ones about towns and cities, short biographies, etc.).
** The second will be to gradually cover the n-grams found in the parallel corpus, in order to cover the different contexts of both those n-grams and particularly of the contexts of them in the already included sentences. 

* After the translation of about 1,000 sentences, an actual system will start to be build weekly. Everyone with some experience in statistical machine translation will agree that 1,000 sentences is a ridiculously low number for statistical translation, but the idea is to have a baseline set up and gradually increment it. Besides that, while the adding of sentences as described above would go on, from time to time the system would be used to translate some of top articles of the English Wikipedia not covered by the foreign one, correct it (with a lot of pain in the first times) and add it back to the corpus. After some time, we should finally be able to [[w:Eat your own dog food|eat our own dog food]], i.e., to do the first raw translation with our statistical systems, not relying anymore in non free systems (however, the usage of free software like Apertium for related languages is likely to still be a better alternative in the foreseeable future).

* The corpora will be gradually tagged with part-of-speech information, lemmas and eventually syntactic information.

* There will be a gradual integration with the Wiktionary and Wikipedia's intralinguistic links, covering not only the the basic lemmas but, hopefully, the most common inflected forms for each language -- the results could be then retributed to Wiktionary with carefully set bots.

== Evaluating with Wikipedias ==

(as originally found in the [http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Evaluating_with_Wikipedia Apertium Wiki]

One of the ways of improving an MT system, and at the same time improve and add content in Wikipedias, is to use Wikipedias as a test bed. You can translate text from one Wikipedia to another, then either post-edit yourself, or wait for, or ask other people to post-edit the text. One of the nice things is that MediaWiki (the software Wikipedia is based on) allows you to view diffs between the versions (see the 'history' tab).

This strategy is beneficial both to Wikipedia and to any machine translation system, such as Apertium or a statistical one based in Moses. Wikipedia gets new articles in languages which might not otherwise have them, and the machine translation system gets information on how we can improve the software. It is important to note that Wikipedia is a community effort, and that rightly people can be concerned about machine translation. To get an idea of this, put yourself in the place of people having to fix a lot of &quot;hit and run&quot; SYSTRAN (a.k.a. BabelFish) or Google Translate translations, with little time and not much patience.

===Guidelines===

*Don't just start translating texts and waiting for people to fix them. The first thing you should do, is create an account on the Wikipedia, and then find the &quot;Community notice board&quot;. Ask there how regular contributors would feel about you using the Wikipedia for tests. The community notice board should be linked from the front page. It might be called something like &quot;La tavèrna&quot; in Occitan, or &quot;Geselshoekie&quot; in Afrikaans. When you are asking them,  make the following clear:

:* This is free software / open source machine translation.
:* You would like to help the community and are doing these translations both to help their Wikipedia expand the range of articles, and to improve the translation software.
:* The translations will be added only with the consent of the community, you do not intend to flood them with poorly translated articles.
:* The translations will be added by a '''human''' not by a bot.
:* Ask them if there are any subjects that they prefer you would cover, perhaps they have a page of &quot;requested translations&quot;.
:* One way of looking at it might be as a non-native speaker of the language trying to learn the language. Point out that the initial translation will be done by machine, then you will try and fix the translation, but anything that you don't fix you would be grateful for other people to fix.

An example of the kind of conversation you might have is found [http://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Geselshoekie/MT here].

===How to translate===

In order to be more useful, when you create the page, first paste in the uneditted machine translation output. Save the page with an ''edit summary'' saying that you're still working on it. Then proceed to post-edit the output. After you've finished, save the page again. If you go to the history tab at the top of the page and do &quot;Compare selected versions&quot; you will see the differences (diff) between the machine translation and the post-editted output. This gives a good indication of how good the original Apertium output was.
: It's also helpful if you first paste the ''input''. Then you can compare 1. input, 2. MT output, 3. post-edit (keeping the input text in the article history might be useful if you want to compare old MT-output with a newer version of the machine translator)

== Existing free software ==
* [[w:Apertium|Apertium]]
** Apertium is an open-source platform (engine, tools) to build machine translation systems, mainly between related languages. Code, documentation, language pairs available from the [http://apertium.org Apertium website].
* Moses (Moses is licensed under the LGPL.)
**&quot; Moses is a statistical machine translation system that allows you to automatically train translation models for any language pair. All you need is a collection of translated texts (parallel corpus).&quot; (from their website [http://www.statmt.org/moses/ Moses website].

There was [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-September/000448.html a thread on the Wikipedia list] that got me thinking about configuration management for Wikipedia.

I agree with the need to accommodate Wikipedia in citations. I also agree with the need to somehow &quot;freeze&quot; articles.

So here's an outline of my proposal:

# Wikipedia is, first and foremost, a perpetual work in progress. I think the [[w:September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]] article is evidence of the value in this principle. Wikipedia contributes to the universal body of human knowledge, offering the unique benefits of Wiki technology: global participation, hypertext, up-to-date information, etc. ''Others may want to flesh out this mission statement.'' We must never compromise this key contribution of Wikipedia.
# Wikipedia also strives to be academically relevant by enabling periodic releases of encyclopedia versions. The period may be much shorter than a conventional encyclopedia, but most information providers seem to be settling on annual updates. This also builds on the strong tradition of hardcopy [[w:almanac]]s. The 2001 edition of the Wikipedia needs to get out soon if we go this route.
# Wikipedia articles can be versioned even more often than the whole Wikipedia. We already do this thanks to UseModWiki, but the calls for &quot;freezing&quot; articles are begging for a baselining system where an article can, to some degree, be called &quot;ready.&quot; They'll never be &quot;finished,&quot; but many are &quot;ready&quot; for &quot;release.&quot;

So that brings me to my overall vision. [http://alum.mit.edu/www/tbc/hacks/ I work] in the field of software process engineering, and from my perspective Wikipedia needs a [[w:configuration management system]].  We have a [[w:revision control system]] for individual articles, but the 10,000 article mark seems a good point to release our first version of the Wikipedia. Eventually (maybe very soon?), Wikipedia will need a supervised release process.

This model is analagous to other [[w:open source]] projects. For instance, [[w:Debian]] released version 2.2r3 on April 17th, 2001. To be a part of that release, developers of all parts of [[w:Linux]] had to &quot;get on the release train,&quot; as it's sometimes called.

Here's a start to get discussion of Wikipedia's configuration management system going.  Current URLs at www.wikipedia.com would continue to reflect the current understanding of the &quot;wild and wooly world.&quot; Articles are &quot;live.&quot; But some new links can be added to each article. Every &quot;released&quot; article could have a link to view diffs compared with older released versions of the article, not just the &quot;older revisions.&quot; We still show visitors the live copy, but we have a link to &quot;release 2001&quot; or release &quot;September 2001&quot; and so on. These named releases are frozen for all time. So the world will know what Wikipedia in 2001 had to say about the universe. There isn't an &quot;edit&quot; link on released pages, but there's a &quot;visit the live, ongoing work-in-progress version of this article,&quot; which still has the edit link.

I still have a lot of vocational work done today, so enough avocational time for today. Talk amongst yourselves...

I think the idea of &quot;relesed&quot; versions of Wikipedia is good, and the released versions would be very nice to send along with Linux distributions. If they were slightly rigged, so that you can browse it locally, but get redirected to the main Wikipedia site when you try to edit, it would probably draw people here as well. --[[Pinkunicorn]]
----
Is the proposal simply that we release sets of articles that are &quot;approved&quot; (somehow) on a periodical basis?  We can't do that until we have set up an approval process. --[[LMS]]

Well, I tried also to describe how we present &quot;released&quot; versus &quot;in progress&quot; versions on the wiki, but I guess you've summed it up. We need an approval process so we can get on with the work of releasing articles for the 2001 Wikipedia. After reading about how Eric Weisstein evolved [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ MathWorld], I now wonder if I'm too optimistic. Maybe Wikipedia isn't mature enough to release a 2001 edition. But I guess we'll never know how close we are to a &quot;release&quot; until we establish criteria for when an article is &quot;done.&quot;  [[user:tbc|tbc]]</text>

Adding my two cents' worth:
In philosophy, &quot;morals&quot; may be considered an inclusive term for any principle of guiding behavior.  Thus, ethics are ALWAYS morals, but of a particular flavor relying on logic and the distinction of creating good versus the opposite.  Morals in the sense of religiously-dictated behavior are termed DEONTOLOGICAL morals, that is, morals given by a god-figure.  Even behavior patterns that we consider to be completely unethical and even, well, immoral, may be considered moral systems, such as the philosophy of the truly pathological personality that only one's own needs and wishes need be considered in guiding behavior.  Of course, this is precisely the kind of moral system that deontological morals and ethics have been formulated to guard against.
John Knouse mailto:jaknouse@frognet.net
---------
Is it in any way useful to draw a distinction between Ethicality and Morality?  Are they not, after all, synonymous?  Doesn't one pretty much imply the other?  Let us answer the three foregoing questions, &quot;Yes, no and no&quot; respectively and see whether such a position is defensible.

The root word for Ethical is the Greek &quot;ethos,&quot; meaning &quot;character.&quot;  The root word for Moral is Latin &quot;mos,&quot; meaning &quot;custom.&quot;

Both words are broadly defined in contemporary English as having to do with right and wrong conduct.  Character and custom, however, provide two very different standards for defining what is right and what is wrong.  Character would seem to be a personal attribute, while custom is defined by a group over time.  People have character.  Societies have custom.  To violate either can be said to be wrong, within its appropriate frame of reference.

It is possible to draw an objective distinction between good and bad, right and wrong, which does not depend on context for a measuring stick.  Let us say that good, or right, would be the quality of those things which tend toward the greatest survival for the greatest cross-section of life and bad, or wrong, would apply to those things which tend away from that greatest survival.  This is a standard which can be objectively tested for, in theory.  

(more to come, as time permits)
----
I have studied ethics quite a bit and I can't say that I have seen the word &quot;ethicality&quot; very often, though I found it in [http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=ethicality a dictionary].  I would rename this page &quot;EthicsVsMorals&quot; (or better yet, &quot;EthicsAndMorals&quot;) and then it will be a topic that more people are apt to recognize. -- [[Larry Sanger]]
----
As you wish...
-----
Another way to look at the distinction is to say that morals are accepted from an authority (cultural, religious, etc.), while ethics are accepted because they follow from personally-accepted principles.  For example, if one accepts the authority of a religion, and that religion forbids stealing, then stealing would be immoral.  An ethical view might be based on an idea of personal property that should not be taken without social consent (like a court order).  Stealing would directly contradict that view.  On the other hand, if one has different basic principles that didn't recognize an item as &quot;property&quot;, a similar action might not be unethical.  (Helping a slave escape would be ethical if one believes people should not be owned as property.)

Professional and &quot;ethical&quot; codes of conduct are an interesting case--they are very similar to morality in that they are often accepted and adhered to in a moral sense.  For example, consider a doctor who follows a professional code of ethics, including a strong requirement to not violate the patient's privacy.  The doctor discovers that a patient has a genetic/inherited disease that is treatable, and that the patient has siblings who are likely to have the same disease.  The patient asks the doctor not to tell anyone (including the siblings) about the disease.  The interesting question is not so much what the doctor should do, but how the doctor should come to a decision.  Should the doctor follow the consensus of the professional community, even if it conflicts with personal ethics?  Would it matter if the rest of the community was united or divided over the question?

----
A formal way of distinguishing them is to define ethics as 'those rules which it is rational for a group to possess so as to govern its external relations with other entities' and define morals as 'those rules which it is rational for a group to possess so as to govern its internal relations between members'. These definitions are consistent with the usage of professional ethics (of a profession with regards to clients, patients, et cetera) versus human morality (how one human should behave with respect to another). And keeping these examples in mind, it simply isn't correct that ethics does not derive from an authority (eg, a doctor's association) or that morality does not come from personally accepted principle. It also shows that professional ethics have nothing to do with the consensus or division in the group involved.
-----
The Simple View of Morals and Ethics is now updated to make distinctions more clearly - the framework is the same but two new assertions are made.  One is Rushworth Kidder's notion that &quot;ethics is the balance of right versus right&quot; in a tradeoff or case-based process.  The other is Craig Hubley's notion that &quot;moral example distinguishes right from wrong, and over time what we choose to emulate creates a 'moral core'&quot; as distinct from a &quot;moral code&quot;.  Common ideas of etiquette and collective responsibility are put in context.
As is the modern idea that morality is aesthetic and personal ultimately, but provides an important fulcrum on which we can balance our ethical decisions &quot;as if we were the other&quot;.

This is completely compatible with the &quot;formal view of ethics vs. morals&quot; in the above entry - if we define ethics as 'those rules which it is rational for a group to possess so as to govern its external relations with other entities' and define morals as 'those rules which it is rational for a group to possess so as to govern its internal relations between members' then we just have to see the ethical codes or rules as sharable among untrusting parties, and the morals not sharable directly but only through stories or examples from trusted parties.  Morals work on a smaller scale than ethics, more reliably, but by addressing human needs for belonging and emulation.

Ethical codes, on the other hand, can allow for &quot;creative accounting&quot; and such.  ;-)

I don't feel that I changed the character of the article, just made certain distinctions - like a list of ethical keywords and a qualification of context in ethics - that are absolutely critical to moral decisions or ethical process in my own experience.  People need to know what they mean by &quot;right&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, and if they use it at all, &quot;evil&quot;.  If everyone knew what they personally meant by these words, and how to trade off one &quot;right&quot; for another, the world would have a great deal less conflict.

That makes perfect sense also if morals come from authority that is the self or the bond between mother and child, or family in general, and if ethics are subscribed to when you voluntarily join a tribe or profession or guild or union or party or faction or corporation or other such voluntary association.

I also dealt briefly with religion's focus on morals vs. philosophy's focus on ethics, and with theology itself.  That's important, especially as most people's idea of 'ontology' comes from XML.  ;-)  And because they never metaphysics they didn't believe in. ;-p

Despite this being in 'meta' I think the anoynimity is also important for this topic, although we should know what sources to look up for details.

----
It seems to me that there is, in fact, no useful distinction whatsoever that can be drawn between the terms &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;ethical&quot;.  An earlier writer mistakenly identified these words with their roots, 'mos' and 'ethos'.  While these really are the &lt;i&gt;roots&lt;/i&gt;, they're not the &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt;; the word in Latin translated as 'moral' is 'moralis', which was coined by Cicero in an attempt to provide an accurate translation of the Greek 'ethikos'.

I have noticed that people who write on the Greeks tend to use 'ethics' while people who write on Kant or Mill (and, obviously, etcetera) tend to use 'morals'.  I'm not entirely certain why that is.

Religion and philosophy in the life of Man.

There is little debate that religion and philosophy have been commonly perceived through the ages as a refining influence on the impulses and actions of men.  Paradoxically, highly contentious debates and great wars have also been inspired thereby.  Why this dichotomy?

It is, perhaps, an issue of value, and of values.  That which offers significant structure and stability, paradoxically leads to great turmoil.

For what do men value, if not their own peace of mind?  And what brings peace of mind?  Answers.  And these answers are couched in a consistent and predictable system of values, that men might know what to expect from each other.   Value.  And values.  What do we hold dear?

And what threatens a man more than that we bid to remove his peace of mind?  How shall we remove it?  Invalidate his answers.  Tear down his religions and his philosophies.  Make as naught the tools upon which he relies to steer his course in life.  To prevent this, he would go to war.  And so the religion in which one society rests its foundation, inasmuch as it conflicts with the religion of a society newly met, poses the danger of instability and anarchy.  The 'other' religion must be stamped out before it gains a foothold and turns the world upon its head.

War.

If not war, then culture war.  Oppression.  Censorship.  Calumny and libel.  At no cost let the infidels make inroads, secure a single convert.  Stability must be maintained.  For man has had enough, in centuries past, of uncertainty.  Uncertainty meant doubt, confusion, danger.  It was a sign of impending loss.  Loss of food, of hunting territory, of life, limb, family or friend.  Let not uncertainty enter in.

And what of the men who provided the answers, the so-precious stability, certainty, predictability?  Were they gods, prophets, saviours?  Were they men rendered more by a divine hand?  Greater in the sight of God?  Were they unassailable, without flaw?  Almost never.  What they were was certain.  Those who followed found security, hope of greater survival, a reason to believe, like the warmth in the dinted snow left by the steps of the sainted King Wenceslaus.

And what of SCIENCE?  What of knowledge, and wisdom gained by peereing through lenses, combining reagents, accelerating quantum particles?  Is this not of greater and more enduring value?  Is this not less subject to attack from unlooked-for sources?  Cannot the mind find its precious broad and stable road here?  Perhaps not.  Not entirely.  For science, too has its limits.  Ask a physicist, &quot;But where did it all come from?  Where is it going?  What is the meaning, the purpose in it?&quot;  Blank stare.  Silly questions.  You have no call to ask them.  Ask me something Scientific.  You moron.

But Man must have his answers.  His mind, supreme arbiter of all that is true and right, has solved the problems put so far.  No problem can be really insoluble can it?  We shall apply the inexorable force of our reason, and the universal secrets will open to us.  We will know Truth.  How will we know it is truth?  Our logic will be seamless.  Our reason without crook or blemish.  The Truth will be self-consistent and consistent with all things.  It will not be gainsaid.  It will be invulnerable to attack.  It will endure.

So what do men need?  Answers.  Answers they can use, which do not fail them, and which have utility in life.  Answers in which they can rest secure that the travails of life will not unseat them, and send them spinning.  Answers, in short, which work for them.  Answers which work.  And you will not disabuse a man of answers thus sought, found and relied upon, answers which give his life shape, texture, color and meaning.  Answers which ease the path of his life and of those he loves.
  
Mount your best assault upon the source, the foundation, the premises, arguments and formulae of his answers.  Tell him the revelator of his truth is a swine.  Prove it in court.  Show pictures.  Film at 11.  But if his answers have met the test of his life, if they have succored him in his need, if they continue to provide the fulcrums and levers which move his mountains, you will make not a dent.  Flattened logical slugs impotent at your feet.  Tattered slings and shattered arrows.  Your keenest arguments and most telling expositions gone like a passing breeze.

So leave Man his answers.   Tamper not with the rudder of his life.  If he steers a clean course and collides not with the reefs or other craft, congratulate him on his seamanship.  Envy him his calm.  And find answers of your own.

As the Internet became a sort of frontier for civilization, it was noticed that there was not some new egalitarian democratic playing field emerging. Rather, petty bureaucracies formed around those who had control of the various &quot;territories&quot; of the internet. Those who controlled the physical access to the servers and networks rose to authority in a way that surprised no one.  After all, this was exactly analagous to what had happened in [[meatspace]] over thousands of years of history. However, the stranger phenomenon was of those who managed to somehow control these internet &quot;territories&quot; even though they had no legal or physical ownership of anything. In some cases, such as [[IRC]], this ownership was enforced by built in devices such as &quot;ops&quot; status, and &quot;kick&quot; and &quot;ban&quot; routines in the program code enabling the authority to banish arbitrary people from these &quot;territories&quot;. In other cases, though, it was by merely working their ass off that a general consensus would grow around a certain person being &quot;leader.&quot;, for what does a leader need other than followers? 

The Internet Authority Disease is a theory to explain how utterly addicted many internet &quot;leaders&quot; become to the sense of power they have on the internet, and the effects it has on their attitude towards the internet, their emotional state, and their feelings towards users.

Unfortunately it's not a very well developed theory at the moment.

Today, August 26th (2001, apparently), marks the completion of a distributed endeavor to copy into Wikipedia,
articles from a 1911 encyclopedia that someone had thoughtfully digitized and placed into
the Project Gutenberg archives. This endeavor had been suggested by someone back when
wikipedia first started, and I had taken the initiative to get the first 20 or so items
posted in (starting, of course, with the letter '[[A]]'.) 20 items was just a drop in
the bucket though; check out [[Alan Millar/Status]] to see them all. Thankfully folks
like Alan, with lots more endurance than I were available to continue posting these
articles, and today I stand amazed that we completed it! Even though it was only
one volume, that's still a ''lot'' of articles!

In my opinion, these articles greatly augment Wikipedia, with necessary data that is
unlikely to just &quot;happen&quot; to be entered by visitors. Consider, for example,
[[Alphonso_X_of_Spain]], a medieval spanish king. Certainly worthy of mention, both
as a world leader and because of his early involvement in astronomy. But would an
entry on this fellow just happen to show up through normal Wikipedia processes? Maybe,
but probably not. Needless to say there are thousands of moderately important people
like Alphonso who *should* be listed in Wikipedia, yet most likely *won't*; at least not
anytime soon.

I don't mean to disparage Wikipedia, quite the contrary. Wikipedia has a number of
strengths that the proprietary encyclopedias will likely *never* have. Of these many
strengths, let me choose just one for elaboration: Timeliness. Let me diverge a bit
on a little example.

This week a new
planetoid-thingee was discovered out in the comet belt. Very important scientific
discovery, but let's say within a few weeks your daughter needs to write a report on it
for high school, and needs more in-depth info than available in those terse CNN news
items. That hard-bound dead-tree encyclopedia might have some useful articles on
asteroids and the solar system, and probably will only be a few years out of date, but
it certainly won't have anything useful on this newly discovered planetoid. Fortunately
you bought your daughter a new computer today and it came with a digital CD ROM
encyclopedia. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, this encyclopedia's asteroid
article is extremely terse (though it does have a photo of an asteroid, but it's
copyrighted with full legal protections of course). And since the CD ROM was published
months before the new planetoid thingee was discovered, you're not likely to find it
there either. You decide to try an online encyclopedia, yet these appear to be just an
online version of the CD ROM you bought; maybe the pay-to-view site can afford to stay
more up to date, but you've paid for two encyclopedia's, and aren't too thrilled about
paying for another. Surely there must be another option...

Your daughter giggles at you. &quot;Silly, just go to Wikipedia!&quot; You do so, and she looks
at the [[Recent Changes]] page to see if anyone's been keeping up to date with the news. Sure
enough: Just today (the 26th of August, only a few days after the discovery), folks have
been busily posting away on all manner of astronomical topics. [[Asteroid]] is rather
terse, but at least includes mention of that planetoid thingee, &quot;asteriod found in 2001,
identified as 2001 KX76&quot;. [[Asteroid/Talk]] includes some extra interesting info not yet
incorporated into the main article. [[Trans-Neptunian object]], [[Kuiper Belt]], [[Planet]],
[[Near-Earth asteroid]], [[Solar system]], and [[Planet X]] have also been updated (or newly
added). Clicking around, she's able to find much more information on astronomers, other
recent discoveries, and historical information to fill in her report. She's even able to
make contact with some other students and teachers interested in this newly found body, and
thereby learn of further sources of information on it, available through the web. When she
is finally done and turns in her report, she decides to also post it up to Wikipedia, as
article [[2001 KX76]]. :-)

Wonderful! Wikipedia comes to the rescue and serves its role in the passing of knowledge
to those who need it.

But you notice two things that are kind of odd. First, of course, there's very few photos in
wikipedia, but that's a whole 'nother topic of discussion. At least there's a photo of
[[Galileo]] on his page. Second, and perhaps more importantly,
many of the supporting articles seem to be rather terse. For example, you compare your
proprietary encyclopedia's lengthy dissertation on Pluto with wikipedia's dinky [[Pluto]] entry.
[[Saturn]] is not much better. [[Charon]] doesn't even exist... Hmm...

Timeliness may be a strength of wikipedia, but ''depth'' may be its weakness. Certainly
we can expect better articles to come from the planets; after all they're big and will
always be there and new things are likely to be discovered about them. But what about
other, older topics? Say you needed to know about the origins of astronomy in the 13th
century. Luckily there's that aforementioned article on Alphonso X of Spain, but what of
historical figures with names starting with B-Z?

The 'A' encyclopedia was digitized by hand, by someone who happened to have a 1911 edition
on hand. Digitization is a lot of work, but it can be done; Project Gutenberg's been at it
for years, and when you think about it, they're not so much different, organizationally,
than we are.

So here is my proposal.

I think we could turn our distributed, collaborative talents and processes towards a
mini-Project Gutenberg endeavor to digitize and copy into Wikipedia a ''full'' set of
out-of-copyright encyclopedias.

I think in the interests of practicality and to make distribution of efforts a bit simpler, we may want to allow variation in years... We could have the 1911 A, 1922 B, 1909 C, etc. I think if we allow this, it eliminates a lot of need for coordination. There will of course be variability in where one volume stops and another starts, and we might have a few articles slip through, but if those articles are important, we may &quot;pick them up&quot; through usual Wikipedia evolution.

There's several steps we'd need to take:

a) First, we would need to determine when a rough cut-off date for copyrights is. Is 1911 the only year open to us, or could a 1920 or 1930 edition be used?

b) Next, we need folks to keep an eye out as they go about their lives, for some old encyclopedia sets. Look in grandparent's closets and bookshelves, a dusty corner office in an old college, book-heavy garage sales, and used bookstores. The set needn't be complete, but it's important that the print quality be good enough to scan. See if you can buy or have one or more of the books.

c) Now, even if an encyclopedia is in the right date range, we still need to pause and verify that the particular edition in hand *is* in the public domain. Copyright law can be complicated, and wikipedia *certainly* doesn't want to take the risk doing anything that could risk a lawsuit from a jealous encyclopedia company some day.

d) I think the easiest and fastest way to scan an encyclopedia volume is also rather destructive: Tear off the cover, break the binding, and cut the pages into loose-leaf, then run them through a scanner. I bet a multi-page feeding scanner would letcha get through a bunch of volumes at once. I suppose one could justify the ruining of an antique book in the knowledge that it's probably near the end of its life in paper form anyway and is bound for a new and even more meaningful life in an electronic form. Note that by leveraging the US Postal System (or fedex), this step need not necessarily be done by the same fellow who did step B. :-)

e) Next is the hard part: Proofreading. But maybe this step could be skipped, if the scanner is good enough. I've noticed that with the volume 'A' articles, spelling and format correction is quick to occur when the article appears in wikipedia. So maybe this step could be just a quick QA to ensure the page isn't garbled and in need of re-scanning.

f) With the article digitized, the next step is to get it into wikipedia. This is the step we already know how to do very well, so nothing more need be said. Judging by how quickly articles have been submitted lately, I'm guessing someone has developed a tool or process we could reuse.

Steps b-f can proceed in parallel; someone in New Jersey could be working on volume 9 of a 1919 encyclopedia, while someone else does volume 21 of a 1912 edition. Coordination can be done peer-to-peer, as folks ask who is working on what, and can see from what's *not* in wikipedia what still needs to be done.

I agree that this is a very important project, and should definitely be done. I am pretty sure that 1911 is the newest public domain version of EB; it is also a very good one (I believe EB was sold to the US afterwards and for a while not much material was added), so sticking with it would be fine.

I think that if we indeed get the scanning project going, we should also donate it to Project Gutenberg, since they gave as volume 1. This means we release it in the public domain I guess.

However, I'm wondering if Project Gutenberg is scanning the other volumes right now. Does anybody know who scanned volume 1? Those people should be contacted. --AxelBoldt

The rest of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica is available on CD-ROM as image files. See http://www.classiceb.com/
So the physical scanning part is already done (no destruction of
books required :-), and all that remains
is the OCR. The files could be then given to Project Gutenberg
and also used here. --[[Alan Millar]]

----
May I suggest we try doing something the [http://www.ccel.org &quot;Christian Classics Ethereal Library&quot;] has done -- you set up a website with the scanned in image of each page, and a text-area for people to transcribe it into. Or if you OCR it in, the OCR won't always be perfect, so you can set this up so people can correct the OCR'd text from the original image.

The problem with using Wikipedia to correct things is that it is unlikely to result in an exact transcription of EB, which is what Project Gutenburg would want.

Finally, I might note that a lot of texts that are public domain (such as EB1911) in the US may still be copyrighted elsewhere, due to past differences in copyright law -- but then so long as Wikipedia is located on a US server, that shouldn't be a problem.

Also, http://www.classiceb.com claims their scanned-in images are copyrighted. As per [[Public Domain Resources/Talk]], they are (probably) wrong -- mere scanning is not of sufficent novelty to create copyright. But they still might cause legal hassles -- so maybe we better just scan it in ourselves.

-- [[Simon J Kissane]]

:They claim copyright on their images and CDs, but not on the text itself; maybe we should just contact them to ask about OCR. They'll probably allow it but won't allow that we put up their images on a web site for people to grab and OCR. Everybody who wanted to participate in the OCR effort would have to buy their own CD set, at $109 a pop. --AxelBoldt

-----
If you don' want to rip a volume apart you can do what I did reasonably successfully with a lot of the Catholic Encyclopedia articles I scanned - photocopy the page, then scan it, ocr, then proof-read it. Of course, I was avoiding working on my dissertation and had free access to copying machines... --[[MichaelTinkler]]

----
Text from: http://www.classiceb.com/faqs.html

However, while the original text of these older editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica are in the public domain, the ClassicEB® CDs are copyrighted by ClassicEB.com in all respects except for the original text. This means that purchasers of any ClassicEB® CDs may not copy our CDs in any way under penalty of violating copyright laws. Users may, of course, print off on paper any or all images contained on the CDs, in unlimited amounts, without violating ClassicEB.com's rights or copyright laws.

If you own your own physical set of the public domain editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica, you may scan your set onto CD and offer them yourself without being in violation of copyright laws. But you may not copy the images contained on the ClassicEB® CDs, nor may you use in any way the manual or any of the index tools contained on the CDs which were designed by ClassicEB.com. Violators of ClassicEB.com's rights will be prosecuted.

:They claim its copyrighted, but I doubt that the images in fact can be copyrighted, since they contain no novelty. (Unlike photographs, there is no creativity in the arrangement, selection of view or lighting.) Just because they say it is copyrighted doesn't mean it is. Though of course, them suing us (even if they lose) wouldn't be fun. -- [[Simon J Kissane]]

:One other thing they probably can't sue you for is re-encoding their scans in a new format, reorganizing them with your own indexes, and burning your own CD from that. Even if you take the raw data from their scans rather than rescanning the paper yourself, you're probably within the scope of ''Feist''. I had planned to buy their CD anyway, just so I can do some manual edits on what are clearly some bad OCRs of the original. When I get the CD I'll do some back-of-the-envelope estimates on what it would take to recode and reburn it for us. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

----

One thing nobody has mentioned is that a lot of things have changed
since 1911, leading to a lot of misleading ideas in articles
scanned directly. A disclaimer at the bottom of the page helps,
but knowing that it's an old text doesn't fix everything, and
it can be hard to expunge all the wrong data. Articles on
physics, for example, would need to be carefully reviewed by
somebody fully up-to-date, lest we bring relativity back into
debate...

Even things like the article on King Alphonso might now be considered apocryphal nowadays - it's my understanding that
history gets revised now and again (even by non-revisionists :))


:I think this is an issue with all content in the Wikipedia, not just entries from old encyclopedias. It is being discussed significantly in a number of different places on the site here. (Before you can expunge wrong data, you have to define &quot;wrong&quot;.) Not to pick on anyone in particular, but I don't perceive any substantial science behind the entry for [[Pheromones]], for example.

:But that just goes back to the basic scheme of Wikipedia: It's not Nupedia, and it isn't intended to be. It's a free-for-all, and anyone can fix anything. --[[Alan Millar]]
----
Yesterday, I just found the complete 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica at my favourite used bookstore, only $180 (Canadian). I don't have the funds for it at the moment (and my scanner is broken), but I'm keeping it in the back of my mind...

:About a month ago when in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, I saw a set for US$ 125.

Working on a project like this gets me seriously annoyed with the current state of copyright law. I have a [[World Book Encyclopedia]] set from the 1970s that I can't even give away. The company that makes World Book won't make a cent off of this material, but because of the copyright, we can't use it for Wikipedia; instead we can only reuse material that hasn't been current for almost a century. &lt;nowiki&gt;*sigh*&lt;/nowiki&gt; -- [[STG]]

----
I've actually got a paper set of the 9th and 10th edition EB, dating 1870-1900 or so. Many of the articles are so old that they might as well be rewritten from scratch, but some seem worth putting up for editing... the volumes are in too good a condition to contemplate wholesale destruction as exhorted above, so I'll tend to be adding shorter articles typed by hand on random subjects. At the very least, it'll help fill in details on obscure topics (and I was impressed by the speed at which extra information was filled in on the [[Fifth monarchy men]]) -- [[Malcolm Farmer]]
----
My opinion is that timeliness is one of our strengths, as those things that interest us get added. I expect that almost every subject will be covered in the next twenty years, and about half of the information will change as well. If we remember that this GREAT project started in January 2001, then compared to that other work, we are accomplishing a great amount. Gutenburg is trying to get Public Domain works in to electronic form, we are creating a new work, which I feel is a different and (in my opinion more satisfying] thing. The Old Stuff is a good start, but those of us living have been creating and discovering a great amount of New Stuff, which needs documentation as well.--[[mike dill]]

----

Why don't you (for some value of ''you'' that is representative of Wikipedia) simply talk to Project Gutenburg and suggest an affiliation between the two projects? They overlap in certain ways, most especially in certain goals and means. It would be a disaster to fork the effort of ''yet another'' project ala Wikipedia-and-FOLDOC. -- SunirShah
--------

It might be more efficient in the long run to rekey the information into wikipedia entries by hand unless the intent is to establish precisely correct and attributed frozen articles for reference.  Even in this case much hand cleanup is typically required for OCR.

It would also potentially provide a way for enthusiastic contributers without a lot of specialized knowledge to participate very heavily very quickly.  If funding mechanism s get put in place then some funds could be used to buy appropriate out of copyright or public domain works and ship  an appropriate volume to a volunteer.  Any body want to tackle the dead sea scrolls or the Illiad?

Just out of curiousity I am going to go check out bible..... surely there must be an out of copyright version of the King James around .... Book of Morman ... Koran in English???   Perhaps these would be better in a controlled environment such as nupedia intends to provide. A draft from Wikipedia however could save a lot of expensive receptionist time typing.  OTOH Commercial endeavers generally have revenue to compensate people for work so perhaps we should not be putting typists out of work.

So confusing!  I better go browse philosophy for a while. 
-- [[user:mirwin]]  

p.s.  If this materializes let me know.  I will find something interesting and educational to type on a few hours a week when my muse discovers how little I actually know sometimes.</text>

The '''In Memoriam wiki''' is a former [[Wikimedia]] project on the [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It was made read-only in September 2006[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/023338.html]. It is no longer online on a Wikimedia site. It was moved to the non-Wikimedia site &lt;link redacted&gt;, where it was read-only, prior to being taken over by spambots. An interwiki link exists ([[sep11:]]) which now points to an Internet Archive-hosted archive of the site (see discussion at [[bugzilla:24805|bug 24805]]). As of August 2010 it's offline. It cannot be accessed through the Internet Archive due to a robots.txt on the advertising page that replaced it.

I'm a little worn out now, as I've spent the last 12 hours straight on this site, so I'll try to keep this brief.

I think that the page [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack] could be one of the great accomplishments of Wikipedia, if everyone gets involved. Already it's pretty remarkable, and it's only been four days. Many people built an amazing [[en:Timeline of the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|timeline]], while my focus has been on the [[en:Casualties of the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|casualties]] entry. But everyone can help in any way.
 
I've put in a lot of effort because I live in New York City, and this is the small way I can do something in honor of the thousands of people who died, including the 350 firefighters who died because they rushed in to save people, and in respect for the thousands of people working until they drop, exhausted, after literally days without sleep, digging through the rubbish, cutting through the twisted steel, and getting this city back on its feet--so well that all over the city people can go back to their cafes, be fashionable, and chat merrily with their friends, as if nothing had happened. And it's important that we do get back to normal--but also that we don't forget what happened. And the only way to prevent that is through the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, the reason for something like Wikipedia.

=== What can you do? ===
(this section is outdated)

&lt;s&gt;First off, remember that you can [[Be bold in updating pages]]. So if you want to plunge headlong, do. There are no experts or masters of building this site--everyone is in charge. That said, here's a list of suggestions, in increasing levels of difficulty or intensity (please add if you think of one):&lt;/s&gt;

=== Build the memorial pages ===
&lt;i&gt;Five minutes or less&lt;/i&gt;
* Go to the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Personal_experiences Personal experiences] page and add your own experience or thoughts
* Go to the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Casualties Casualties] page, pick one person on the list, and build their initial entry using the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Casualties_template template]
* If you know a victim on the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Casualties Casualties] page, please build or add to their entry 
* Scroll down to the external references that haven't been fully incorporated and add that information 
* Track down the online version of the newspaper local to the lost and use the info to write up the entry. 

&lt;i&gt;Several minutes to several hours&lt;/i&gt;
* Find authoritative lists of the missing and add the names, properly formatted, to the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Missing_persons Missing Persons] page
* Figure out how to redesign the Personal experiences page (break it up, most like) to make it useful and easily navigable

&lt;i&gt;Best of luck to you!&lt;/i&gt;
* Build a dynamic, sexy frontend to the pages, get a memorable and appropriate URL, and give the memorial pages their own virtual site
* Convince professional media organizations such as the New York Times to put its memorial reportage into the public domain for the public good

=== Build the historical pages ===
&lt;i&gt;Five minutes or less&lt;/i&gt;
* When you hear new information, add it to the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Timeline Timeline]
* As you surf (or scour) the web for stories, make note of the urls of informational stories and add them at the bottom of the appropriate subpages.
* Go through info on the Timeline and incorporate it into the appropriate subpages. If they don't exist, make them.
* Edit current subpages for content, style, and formatting

&lt;i&gt;Several minutes to several hours&lt;/i&gt;
* Write comprehensive, critical entries (like the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/terrorism terrorism], [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/Osama_Bin_Laden Osama Bin Laden], or even [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/box-cutter_knife box-cutter knife] entries) on related topics, such as militant Islam, the tension between civil rights and security throughout history, or the construction of passenger jets and why their pilot doors are made to open easily, even if locked (there are a lot of good reasons).

&lt;i&gt;Best of luck to you!&lt;/i&gt;
* Hack Wiki to allow the use of templates, so complex subsites like this can be more easily managed and rapidly prototyped (to use a little bizness jargon)

You can also promote the site through whatever means you desire, getting people to link to it, making a simple logo/button, etc.

Of course, there isn't really a hard line between the memorial and historical pages--all the pages act as one great memorial, and every individual page is a bit of history, from the &quot;big&quot; names ([http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/John_P._O_Neill John P. O Neill]) to the &quot;little&quot; names ([http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Dana_Falkenberg Dana Falkenberg]).

In particular, I've tried to make it as easy as possible to build intial entries for the casualties, which can then become full-blown tribute pages over time. It takes less than five minutes to build an entry. To do all of them is an impossible task for one person, a simple task for all of us.

'''[[w:Wikisource|Wikisource]]''' is a Wikimedia project to build a library of free texts. Initially called &quot;Project Sourceberg&quot; when it began in 2003, it branched into subdivisions for individual languages by 2005. Now Wikisource libraries house books, novels, essays, historical documents, poems, letters, speeches and other documents, so long as they can be made available under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ CC-BY-SA] open content license.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is it &quot;MetaWikipedia&quot;, &quot;Metawikipedia&quot;, &quot;Meta Wikipedia&quot; or &quot;Meta-Wikipedia&quot;?

The above question is not as frivolous as it seems - there are a bunch of pages I want to create but don't want to end up sending them all to the delete bin later on for having the wrong name.

Here's a voting forum:

&quot;MetaWikipedia&quot; - 3 &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Metawikipedia&quot; - 0 &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Meta Wikipedia&quot; - 0 &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Meta-Wikipedia&quot; - 0 &lt;br&gt;

Other suggestions...

&quot;Meta-Wiki&quot; or similar - [[user:Dave McKee|Dave McKee]] &lt;br&gt;

I'd also like to see some attempt at clearly defining the purpose of this meta space - from a pessimistic viewpoint it could easily end up becoming a wiki-usenet. 

MetaWikipedia looks best to me. It's also a tip-of-the-hat to the WikiCamelCase tradition. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

Hey, my script is actually put to work. Cool!

Magnus - it rocks. It is a huge improvement over the original software.
:Thanks!--[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

Some minor problems - on the preferences tab &quot;address&quot; is spelt &quot;adress&quot;.
On the welcome screen after creating a new login &quot;preferences&quot; is spelt &quot;perferences&quot; [[user:Manning Bartlett|Manning Bartlett]]
:Fixed.--[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

Nice job on the new software. I downloaded the CVS tree and installed it as I want to test it for use with my DarwinWiki project. Is there a mySQL script to setup the initial database? One thing you might want to keep in mind is that you may want to generalize the script and use some variables (e.g. $WIKINAME=&quot;Wikipedia&quot;) to allow individuals to use the software on other projects. [[user:John Lynch|John Lynch]]
:Thanks! I am glad (and proud:) that the scipt is to (most) people's liking. There are several things I plan to add, like a &quot;module&quot; with variables that contain the ''complete'' fixed text for the wiki, so it can be adapted to different purposes and languages. Also, I'll add a &quot;dummy&quot; database. But unfortunately, my time is a little short till the end of December, since I am preparing for my &quot;final tests&quot;, so the little programming I can do will go into fixing bugs. After December, I'll be back running full hacking power ahead again! --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

Magnus, some things to note.

* When emitting attributes, you must enclose them in quotes. 

* When referring to document.f.EditBox, there had better be a .f.EditBox, which there isn't. This is giving a script error.

* '''http://www.example.com.''' should only link to http://www.example.com . http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiSyntax is non-regular. You have to use some sort of multipass system, such as the token system used in UseModWiki, or a stack. It's not clear if the language is context-free, though I doubt it. That would be so non-Perl. ;)

* Have you looked at Tavi and PHPWiki? 
** Tavi is a UseModWiki clone, and it is very faithful to the design principles that we put into UseModWiki. http://tavi.sourceforge.net

** PHPWiki is its own beast, but it's been around longer with a far more active community than Tavi. http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net

* To understand some of the design principles of UseModWiki, you should read MeatballWiki. http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl In particular
** http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity
** http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiSyntax
** http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?KeptPages

* From that, you should know that KeptPages is capable of elegantly and securely handling page deletion by the community at large. From the mailing list, apparently this is a problem. http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PageDeletion 

* For namespaces, have you looked at how TWiki http://www.twiki.org and the very mature and advanced FoxForumWiki http://fox.wikis.com do this?

* I think you'll notice the syntax for unordered lists isn't working.

* The colours for the diffs are very hard to read. I suspect colour blind http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ColourBlind people would agree. If not, I'd think people are going colour blind just from the purple on pastel approach. ;) Use black for the foreground text.

Hello magnus, I really like the new wiki - it is very confortable to use. One suggestion: could you make the 'Talk' subpage change colour or something to indicate that text exists there, otherwise it is impossible to know if somebody has a comment to make. -- [[user:sodium|sodium]]

:Thanks! This must become a bit annoying - having spent time writing a great piece of software your personal page turns in to a feature/bug list for it ;) BTW you seem to have noticed my not exactly top-notch spelling (chromosone/chromosome + Roswell/Roslin). -- [[user:sodium|sodium]]
----
I agree with both of sodium's above sentences.  :-) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----
Is this the place to report problems with the new software? When I submit an article and find a minor error, I usually click my browser's back button, edit, mark &quot;this is a minor edit&quot;, and then &quot;save&quot; again. This works fine with UseModWiki, but with your software I get an edit conflict (with myself, obviously). I think the software should tolerate the case when a new submission based on the old serial number is made by the same author. I think UseModWiki does this right. --[[user:LA2]]
:Until I fix that (which will take some time), hit the &quot;reload&quot; button ''after'' going back to the edit page. This will reset the time-based edit conflict detection. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

----
Magnus - just another comment. Can we have a &quot;Search&quot; or a &quot;Go&quot; button besides the search box? I personally prefer having something I can click on rather than having to hit &quot;enter&quot; - [[MMGB]]

Hi Magnus,

I would like to help with the beta testing of the client side editor mentioned.  This is a great idea, and I would be glad to be part of its development.

Please tell me where I go to download your software.

==Enhanced Recent Changes as Default==

Magnus amazing work!.
I am currently running MediaWiki version 1.5Beta3 and was wondering how can I set as default the Enhanced recent changes for all users when they register their account. While still leave the option available for users preferences to uncheck it. I went briefly over the DefaultSettings.php but couldn't find the parameter related to this setting.

Thanks!

==Hebrew Wikipedia==
Nice &amp; very interesting work, but ... It dose not work on the [http://he.wikipedia.org/ Hebrew Wikipedia]. It's really a pity as the combination of the Hebrew language (RTL) and the complex HTML tags makes tables editing almost impossible.&lt;BR&gt;
Can you please check if there is something you can do to help us. Our SysOp is [http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:Brion_VIBBER], I'll drop him a message also. 10x anyway ^^ [[User:Dod1|Dod1]] 08:23, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Draft about Wikipedia-on-DVD ==

Hello Magnus,

I just had the thought that Wikipedia really should build a Wikipedia-on-DVD distribution. When I searched for projects that aim to build such a distribution, I couldn't find any. So I started to write a draft about why I think a Wikipedia-on-DVD distribution is important and how it could be achieved, when I accidentally came to this page and saw that you are developing a similar system.

Though, as I have already written the draft now and I really think it includes some interesting ideas, I decided to publish it at [[User:Robamler]]. Perhaps you can use some of the ideas in this draft. Please note that this draft was only meant as the start of a discussion. I don't want to put thru my opinions if others don't agree with me. I would also be glad if I could help your project somewhere, though I'm not familiar with the Wikipedia database system.

Where is the Client-side editor holding now, a few days before 2005?

----
[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39187583,00.htm German wikipedia DVD] I think for now maybe you should keep the same interface (html)
and let people update the dvd version. 

After that you could start on the other parts. (multimedia in special section as well as normal...)

I would like to test it

It's currently BROKEN - if there are ANY images in the article at all (such as from cleanup templates, audio version templates or anything else) it refuses to search saying there are already images in the article.

== Lyrics ==

Dear Wikimedia Personnel,

I would like to propose that we use this wiki has a sister project for searching lyrics of songs, with the words and phrases being lead to their [http://en.wikitionary.org Wikitionary] pages. That way it is easier to understand whether or not songs are appropriate, because the songs might have inappropriate lyrics some '''parents''' would not understand. I suggest the name to be '''Wikirics'''.

::::@MZMcBride: Thanks! And sorry for the loss of that change. By the way, it looks like this is a flaw in the stylesheet for monobook or common in core MediaWiki, not just here on Wikimedia. Could you please file a report in BugZilla? If I recall correctly, the hiding-method was changed in 1.18 or 1.19 because &lt;code&gt;display: none;&lt;/code&gt; had side-effects defeating its very purpose! Screenreaders are given a link that jumps to &lt;code&gt;#jump-to-nav&lt;/code&gt;. However browsers can't scroll to a section that has no place in the rendering, it has to have a place in the document structure and also in the visual rendering (so that the browser can calculate to which pixel it should scroll). The element can be transparant and only 1x1px in size, but it must not be &lt;code&gt;display: none;&lt;/code&gt;. This new hiding method was apparently only tested in Vector and works there, but it needs fixing in Monobook (or perhaps a different hiding method that doesn't cause this problem in Monobook). Either way, using &lt;code&gt;display: none;&lt;/code&gt; (as you did now) is not an acceptable solution in the long term. It's okay for now since it is an understandable decision to prioritize the ability for most people to click the navigation links at all, then to allow the smaller part of the population to be able to skip to the navigation using screenreaders, but really both are important groups so this should be fixed soon and this local change reverted. –''[[User:Krinkle|Krinkle]]''&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Krinkle|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:24, 25 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: No problem. I'm just glad that there was an easy fix to the problem. I didn't have the time or energy to do a full investigation, but you seem to be headed in the right direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{essay|specifiedcategory=Essays related to Wikipedia}}
Suppose we wanted to categorize encyclopedia projects, e.g., Nupedia, Wikipedia, Encarta, Britannica, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and so forth. For this, we could produce an exhaustive set of encyclopedia project characteristics. Differences among the projects' characteristics would distinguish the projects. For example, Nupedia is carefully-controlled; Wikipedia isn't. Nupedia and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy pay only a few people; Britannica, presumably, pays everyone involved. Nupedia is not proprietary; Encarta is. Etc.

The elements of an encyclopedia project can be characterized in terms of functions (e.g., article-writing), goals, and a few other items. One can then present a number of choices about how each function is performed. A number of such choices are listed below; this isn't an exhaustive list.

1. The writing function
* Who writes in what configurations: strictly individuals; individuals and coauthors; strictly teams
* Who can revise an article (after it's posted): author; author and selected other people (e.g., editor); anyone (moderated); anyone (unmoderated)
* How writers are found: volunteers; invitations; combination of volunteers and invitations
* Who assigns authors: subject editors; head editor; self-assignment
* Minimum qualifications of writers
* Is writing paid work?

2. The review function
* Who has the right to make changes to the text: author; author and editor; author, editor, and designated reviewer(s); anyone (moderated); everyone (unmoderated)
* Who has the right to comment on the text: editor; reviewer and editor; designated reviewers and editor; everyone (moderated); anyone (unmoderated)
* Qualifications of reviewers
* How reviewers are found: volunteers; invitations; combination of volunteers and invitations
* Who choose reviewers: head editor; subject editors; other reviewers
* Is reviewing paid work?

3. The copyediting function
* Who copyedits: designated copyeditor(s); anyone (moderated); anyone (unmoderated)
* Qualifications of copyeditors
* Who chooses copyeditors: head editor; subject editors; chief copyeditor; author; self-assigned
* Is copyediting paid work?

4. The acceptance function
* Who gives final acceptance of an article: the head editor; subject editors; a vote (among various different people--different possibilities here); acceptance is automatic once a process is complete, there is no special acceptance procedure
* When acceptance (i.e., publishing) is done: after writing; after reviewing; after copyediting
* Is acceptance paid work?

5. The posting (technical) function
* Paper or electronic
(Etc. We needn't concern ourselves with this now?)

6. General characteristics of official policies
* Level of detail
* Level of enforcement
* The degree to which traditional/mainstream values are expected in *editing standards* (e.g., copyediting standards that &quot;push the envelope&quot;)
* The degree to which traditional/mainstream values are expected in the *content-creation process* (e.g., Wikipedia is extremely nontraditional; Stanford is extremely traditional; Nupedia is in between)

7. Goals of the project
* Quality of articles
* Quantity of articles
* Rate of article production
* Timeliness of articles (how out-of-date we're willing to let an article get)
* Subject matter (general vs. specialized)
* Special aspects of authors (e.g., an international base of authors)
* Special aspects of readers (ditto)
* Popularity (online, measured by traffic)
* Lack of bias/bias acceptable/bias (of a particular sort) desired
* Make a profit or employment for the encyclopedists; contribute (without compensation) to freely-available knowledge

The items in #7 ought to determine our choices in #1-6 (if we're being rational).
----
'''Discussion'''

What does &quot;coordinating all of the aspects of the the encyclopedia&quot; mean? --[[LMS]]

A: A mostly systematic review of article content, format, topic hiearchy, link structure, etc. Most of these should be self-healing processes and could be placed within other categories such as copyediting. 'Self healing' because wiki is almost a genetic organism with new mutations created/altered/destroyed on an ongoing basis.

Wiki - the 'Self healing genetic algorithmic public encyclopedia'
----
I see. Well, indeed, &quot;self-healing&quot; ought to be entirely included in the other processes. The processes aren't necessarily discrete; they might work all at the same time, depending on the system. --[[LMS]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't know if anyone wants to discuss this topic of breadth vs. depth. Originally I was going to say that breadth should be preferred to depth in the beginning; then I considered the wonderfully in-depth articles some people have written, and I was thinking we should encourage more of that; but now I think we should encourage everything!

One very prolific member has been writing a wonderfully in-depth guide to [[poker]]. Meanwhile, lots of other card games, and other games, go undiscussed. But that's fine. In other areas (e.g., [[computing]], we're achieving excellent breadth, but rather little depth so far. In many cases, people are content to simply write definitions of the subjects in the title.

I counsel patience. In fact, I think it's great that people feel completely free to pursue topics either way. One of the great things about Wikipedia is that anyone can come in and do as little or as much as they like.

I have a feeling that experts (snobs, some might say) might happen upon Wikipedia, and look at selected areas of the wiki and, failing to understand what's going on here, will point to the lack of depth as a sign that there are only dilettantes on board here, who are only interested in bite-sized pieces of knowledge. But such snobs simply will have to explore further and bethink themselves that, once the breadth of topics is explored, depth is all that's left.

I think that both breadth and depth on Wikipedia are nearly inevitable. As some of us exhaust the breadth of various subjects, others of us will have written stuff that, being more in-depth, appears to be more &quot;intellectually respectable&quot; to the aforementioned experts. I think we've already come from the point where, to Nupedia, Wikipedia seems to be a silly game, to the point where we're now at least a source of abundant information, some of it surprisingly good. And that's just in the space of three months. In three years, if we and the many, many more who will arrive, keep at it, this is going to be just really quite an amazing resource. --[[LMS]]

:I agree with your viewpoint, LMS, for this reason: I have seen how the Internet (well, the WWW to be precise) has followed this very path.

:When I first started to look for content on the Internet (which was thru http, gopher &amp; ftp protocols), the uneven distribution was very obvious. Many topics were little more than stubs, or represented by the annoying ubiquitous ``Under Construction&quot; logo. Only a few -- which tended to be pop culture subjects, esp. various attractive female personalities, &amp; computer-related subjects -- had anything that could be called depth to them. The best thing that could be said at this point was that the Internet ``had a lot of potential.&amp;quot;

:Fast forward 8 years to now. Not only is the content both broader &amp; deeper, but it is easier to access. Pick a subject &amp; enter it into Google: you are bound to find something both relevant &amp; useful within 5 minutes for practically anything. A few topics will prove to be too specialized for easy access, &amp; others will be handicapped by the fact anyone can create a webpage &amp; that any webpage can vanish in the blink of an eye, but the resources are out there. The chief challenge is attempting to judge which webpages are reliable, &amp; which should be ignored.

:And here is an opportunity for Wikipedia: by providing an introduction to topics that are NPOV, the researcher is provided with a tool to determine whether a given webpage contains information that is generally reliable, or reflects the exclusive &amp; tendentious viewpoint of a zealous minority.

:Just a thought. -- [[User:Llywrch|Llywrch]] 00:59 Dec 12, 2002 (UTC)

When I look for content on the Internet, I am usually looking for two types of information.&lt;br&gt;
The first : a couple of lines for a definition, immediate localisation of a place, quick description of an event. I don't want to be bothered by details. I want it quick and clear.&lt;br&gt;
The second : comprehensive information on a matter I already know quite a lot. I look for facts, references, opinions.  I can't satisfy myself with approximation. I don't want to be bothered by hazy knowledge. I want details.

Internet usually provides pretty well these two levels of information. But there are uncertainties on the neutrality and the reliability. And it takes time. Paper encyclopedia can satisfy first point pretty well. Very rarely satisfy the second. Not enough room, quickly outdated info.

What wikipedia should provide is easy access to the two levels of information. Problem is, there is usually only one page to provide the two levels. Just providing the first level on a small page, and then nicely spreading around the in-depth information on surroundings pages might be an answer sometimes. But one could miss some of the very important points, lost on a maze of interrelated pages.

Hence, either we find a way to treat the information on the two levels in the same page - which basically could mean, develop a proper short paragraph to very quickly cover the subject (cover, not introduce), then, below, provide an extensive article. And make obvious the separation between the two levels. The one line definition given at the top of the article is imho unsufficient : usually a dictionary definition. &lt;br&gt;
Or, we must try to give more structure to some pivot articles, making them the central place where all related meaningful articles are clearly made obvious.

-----
Bite sized chunks are the right size. It forces review of previously written material, easier classification of articles, and easier cross-linking of the different meanings of a term.
-----
With respect, I would point out that when it comes to very technical, specialized material, it is difficult to break discussions easily into parts. See, e.g., the articles in [[mathematics]]. A great deal of specialized knowledge, e.g., in my own field of [[philosophy]], consists of what might be called &quot;narratives&quot;--that is, familiar accounts of problems, solutions, arguments on both sides, etc. Parts of such accounts can be broken down (as I've started to do with [[Larrys Text]]) but then again, other parts just can't, without interrupting the &quot;narrative.&quot; --[[LMS]]
----
I come down in favor of depth over breadth. Here's why: In-depth articles, and your poker example is an excellent one,
will bring in links and with that Google searches. More Google visitors are our best avenue to growth.

If an article is researched in 10 minutes and written in 5, then it doesn't do much good: everybody who is seriously interested
in that topic could have just spent 10 minutes researching and would have come up with the same results. So it doesn't really help the non-experts; the experts of course will giggle about it. But an article
that took a week to research is a truly valuable gem, may even give the experts something to think about and will increase the perceived status of the Wikipedia. --AxelBoldt

: On the other hand, short articles encourage improvement. I often check the recent changes list, and if I think I know a lot about a topic, I'll look at what's been written and see if I think I can improve on it. So just having a new topic can inspire new pages that end up being reasonably substantial. --[[Belltower]]

One is really taking advantage of the software by covering a topic, not with one big article, but with a network of smaller articles. For example, one could write a long 10,000 word essay on some famous person like Ben Franklin, which is no different from a traditional print article. Or, one could write an eight paragraph bio about Franklin, and then another article on each important aspect of his life: [[Ben Franklin/Childhood]], [[Ben Franklin/Printer]], [[Ben Franklin/Colonial representative in England]], [[Ben Franklin/Paris years]], [[Ben Franklin/Electricity]], [[Ben Franklin/Bastard children]]. As these little articles are completed, they form a complete article, which is easier to reference because it is broken down into meaningful categories. It is also easier to update since the parts are separate from the whole, so work can be done on one section without effecting the others. And, it should be easier to create, because the work can be done piecemeal. You can start with a brief overview, then outline the important subtopics, then come back to these as time permits, or let others follow up your lead. We see this happening on the [[World War II]] page, where the major battles and figures of the era were listed.

This process of creating articles piecemeal is called '''Modular content creation'''.

This relates to the breadth vs. depth debate, because it shows that breadth, if seeded properly, will grow its own depth.

The grand and glorious modular content paradigm allows for and encourages a great deal of redundancy. At first this might seem like a bad thing, like we are squandering electrons or something. Then we remember that, unlike more traditional mediums, we are not confined by a limited number of pages, or even minutes, and so can be as redundant as we please. Why would redundancy be pleasing? Because the same fact or set of facts may have relevance in multiple contexts. For example, Ben Franklin's activities in Paris should be discussed in a treatment of his role in the establishment of the United States, but should also, one suspects, be considered in a treatment of his philandering. His work on electricity will have an important place in any treatment of his life, but also in articles about 18th century science, or late-colonial life. In traditional mediums, one is forced to organize information according to one plan: one can write a chronological history of Franklin from birth to death, or one can treat different aspects of his life separately, but not both. Here, we &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; do both, and anything else we think of. If every module is self-contained, then readers can obtain information within only the contexts in which they are interested. And the modules can be linked to and referenced only as needed, such that someone doing an article on the great philanderers could simply link to [[Ben Franklin/Bastard children]] and ignore all that business about science and politics.

----
An example of this is in American football. Each article is very short for the most part, consisting in many cases of only a definition of a term. If one already understands a term, he may read ahead in the body of one of the larger articles. If not, he can skip over to the term and return, thus getting an ever-deeper, ever-broader understanding of the subject. If one were to try to make a coherent whole of all that data in a single article and make it flow, it would be a daunting task. Done in bits, however, it was cake. [[AyeSpy|AS]]

Yes, though parenthetically I might say these short articles should be subcategories, as [[American football/Down]] rather than [[football down]]. - [[TimShell|TS]]

I agree--this also makes linking among sibling pages easier and more likely to be relevant. I'm about to refactor some of my [[poker]] pages to take advantage of this. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]
----
I agree that this is a nice advantage of hypertext, and we should use it when appropriate, but I'd caution about taking small chunking ''too'' far. As I said on [[Wikipedia commentary/Breadth and depth]] (in response to what someone else said), there are aspects of fields that consist of what might be called &quot;narratives&quot; that are rather difficult to break down into chunks. I would add here that it's sometimes (not always, but ''sometimes'') very important, for understanding, that these chunks be kept together ''on the same page''--a lot of people won't follow hyperlinks for fear of losing the thread of the &quot;main&quot; article or for failing to see the relevance of the linked article to the &quot;main&quot; article.

I think the football articles are a fine example of how &quot;modular content creation&quot; can work well. Another good example would be articles about basic technical terms in computer science and in biology. I also totally agree about the importance of relatively small chunks in order to be able to organize those chunks into larger articles organized in different ways; the example of Ben Franklin's discovery of electricity is great. It has a place in an article--no, a set of readings--about the American Revolution, but it also has a place in a set of readings about the history of scientific discovery. Actually, though, I'd rather see it labelled [[Ben Franklin's discovery of electricity]] rather than [[Ben Franklin/Discovery of electricity]]. Generally, subpages are messy, and I've decided I don't much like 'em except for very limited uses (e.g., &quot;talk&quot; pages). But, by the way, Lee, I think your [[poker]] pages do show one way to use them that makes sense. --[[LMS]]</text>

{{Template:Wikipedia is not paper/language}}
{{essay|specifiedcategory=Essays related to Wikipedia}}

Although [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] is an [[w:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]], it is not bound by the same constraints as a paper encyclopedia or even most online encyclopedias. The length, depth, and breadth of articles in Wikipedia is virtually infinite. As Wikipedia grows, so will computing power, storage capacity, and [[w:Bandwidth|bandwidth]]. While there is a practical limit to all these at any given time, Wikipedia is not likely ever to outgrow them.

Founder [[w:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] has stated his desire that Wikipedia should not become yet another discussion forum. But it definitely is something different from a paper encyclopedia, and Wikipedians should take advantage of that fact.

==No size limits==

The most obvious difference is that there are, in principle, no size limits in the Wikipedia universe. It is quite possible, for example, that when you finish typing in everything you want to say about [[w:Poker|poker]], there might well be over 100 pages, and enough text for a full-length book by itself. This would certainly never be tolerated in a paper encyclopedia, which is why ''[[w:Encyclopedia Britannica|Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' has such limited information on the topic (and on most other topics).

Plain text takes up an almost negligible amount of disk space. At seven letters per word, a 300 GB hard drive that costs around $40 US can hold 45 billion words, which amounts to 12.1 million words “per penny”. As of 2012, a 1 TB hard drive costs about the same amount that 300 GB used to cost when this article was first written. A 1 terabyte hard drive can hold 153.6 billion words (1024 GB = 1 TB), which amounts to 38.4 million words per penny. (and growing)

The [[w:Nupedia|Nupedia]] FAQ rightly warned about taxing a reader's patience with rambling prose, but detailed subtopics and sub-subtopics enrich Wikipedia with information. There is no reason why there shouldn't be a page for every [[w:The Simpsons|Simpsons]] character, and even a table listing every episode, all neatly cross-linked and introduced by a shorter central page. Every episode name in the list could link to a separate page for each of those episodes, with links to reviews and trivia. Each of the 100+ poker games can have its own page with rules, history, and strategy. Jimbo Wales has agreed: ''Hard disks are cheap.'' {{fact}}

==Organization==
Of course, a 100-page thesis on poker is useless to someone who merely needs an article summarizing the basic rules and history of the game. The purpose of a normal encyclopedia is to provide the reader a brief overview of the subject, while a reference book or text book can explain the details. Wikipedia can do both. Because Wikipedia is not on paper, it can provide summaries of all subjects of interest ''and also'' provide exhaustive detail on those subjects, conveniently linked, categorized, and searchable for readers who want more detail.

The key to avoiding [[w:information overload|information overload]] is to break an article down into more than one page (long articles require many sub-headings anyway). For example, Poker can be broken into a basic &quot;Poker&quot; article which is only one page (about 30 KB) and links to &quot;History of poker&quot;, &quot;Modern popularity of poker&quot;, and variations of the game, such as &quot;[[w:Stud poker|Stud poker]]&quot; and &quot;[[w:Texas hold 'em|Texas hold 'em]]&quot;. These will be much more searchable. As a more general example:

Acme, an overview
:History of acme
:Physical description of acme
:Relationship with zeta

These can start out as section headings and be broken out into separate pages as the main article becomes too long.

On the other hand, [[w:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia is not]] a general knowledge base of any and all information, full of railroad timetables and comprehensive lists. But any encyclopedic subject of interest should be covered, in whatever depth is possible.

And, of course, Wikipedia is on the Internet, but Wikipedia is not the Internet. For the Internet is used for commerce, news, self-promotion, creative arts, useless rambling, pornography and a whole host of other things not suitable for an encyclopedia, even one as limitless as Wikipedia.

==Style and functionality==
Some standards of writing that apply to paper don't really apply to Wikipedia. Jimbo Wales has said that Wikipedia needs its own style standards, but these will evolve to suit its needs and abilities. He adds, &quot;And of course, the open nature of the software means that enforcement only comes to the extent that we authors care to enforce it.&quot;

For example, CMS ([[w:The Chicago Manual of Style|The Chicago Manual of Style]]) tells the writer or editor to briefly gloss, or explain, the first use of an abbreviation (as just demonstrated with &quot;CMS&quot;). Jargon can be treated similarly. This treatment makes a lot of sense on paper: if an article mentions an arcane subject or if it uses an abbreviation or jargon, the reader may need to know more about it, and so giving a full name or a cross-reference will help find it. But Wikipedia has something even better than a parenthetical gloss of just a few words: an electronic link to a  thorough treatment of the subject.

Paper-based publishing style:
 It is unclear if IBM's code page 437 (a character code set)
 was based on the VT-220 terminal (a computer input/output
 device) of DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation), or if the
 reverse was the case.

Wikipedia publishing style:
 It is unclear if [[w:IBM|IBM]]'s [[w:code page 437|code page 437]] was based on the [[w:VT220|VT220 terminal]]
 of [[w:Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], or if the reverse was the case.

Likewise, &lt;font color=green&gt;[[w:color|color]]&lt;/font&gt; is trivial on the Web, and [[en:WP:MOS#Color_coding|almost everyone can access it]]. This is very expensive for paper, and so color doesn't get used much in paper publishing. Wikipedia should take advantage of this fact, especially with illustrative diagrams and photographs.

Animation and interactivity are impossible on paper. GIF animations and HTML interactivity are relatively easy to create for Wikipedia, and immensely valuable in demonstrating processes and actions. Care must be taken not to make animations ungainly or platform-specific, but standards for judicious use will be established as animation and interactivity become more common.

Due to the new [[ParserFunctions|parser functions]], automatically updated time-dependent information such as [[w:en:Template:Age|age]] can be supplied.

The basic rule &quot;Wikipedia is not paper&quot; also applies to the titles of the articles. There is no reason to use the reverse naming in most cases, just because paper encyclopedias do that. The problem of category sorting in Wikipedia is solved by the engine and special sorting keys.

==Timeliness and ease of editing==
Although, as Jimbo Wales has said, it is best to write in a timeless fashion, because it is likely that many pages will grow gracefully old, Wikipedia allows readers to edit material that has become outdated or requires more detail. In this way, brief overviews can become detailed treatises (although they should still start with a brief overview).

The articles in a paper encyclopedia are all compiled and printed at roughly the same time, and old sets are generally replaced by whole new sets. But Wikipedia pages cannot assume that the reader will have any idea about the historical context in which the article is written, or the state of any article to which it refers.

Wikipedians must be careful, then, to imagine how an article might appear to someone reading it after changes have been made in articles to which it links. This is a rare instance of something that is actually ''more difficult'' in a wiki than on paper. Not only will a list of [[w:recent celebrity deaths|recent celebrity deaths]] obviously need to be rewritten once those deaths aren't recent anymore, but any article that links to it because a certain celebrity has just died may leave the reader wondering what the link was for, since the celebrity will no longer appear on that page.

The general recommendation is to just write time objectively. As a result, Wikipedians don't write, &quot;today&quot; or &quot;recently&quot; (even more so than paper encylopedia writers); they write absolute times when times are necessary and don't mention time at all when it isn't necessary. An exception is dynamic information such as age (see above).

Conversely, Jimbo Wales has said, Wikipedia can very quickly have a page on any hot topic that people may suddenly find interesting (provided it is not completely ephemeral). If something important happens in, say, [[w:East Timor|East Timor]], then Wikipedians can create an article for East Timor or, if one exists, update the article and put it on Wikipedia's [[w:Main page|main page]]. Wikipedia co-founder [[w:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] notes that this sort of basic background information about people and places in current events is sometimes much more important than the current events themselves.

Lastly, Wikipedia is a collaboration between all those who have something pertinent to contribute, so a Wikipedia article does not have an &quot;author&quot; in the traditional sense. This helps all authors feel free to edit, re-arrange, and build on others' work. This generally results in a better final product.

==Environment==
Wikipedia does not need trees to be cut down to print its pages or gasoline to be refined to deliver its content.  It requires electrical energy, affordable computing infrastructure and world wide access to a [[w:Grid computing|planetary computing grid]] to meet its articulated goal of providing free access to human knowledge for all humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== When to use external links ==
Not very often. If the site you are linking to is an article, history or timeline, then Wikipedia should have its own article on that subject, not just an external link. The web is already full past capacity of sites composed of links to other sites.

If the content is free (in the [[:w:GNU FDL]] / free as in speech sense), consider copying and wikifying it for us. If it's not, you can cannibalise it. Extract the facts and rewrite it (&lt;b&gt;in your own words&lt;/b&gt; since their words are copyright) or alternatively place a link to it in the talk page so that someone else can do so.

There are exceptions, of course. It is quite reasonable to link to Donald Knuth's own web page in our [[:w:Donald Knuth]] article, for example.

In short one shouldn't link externally to anything that we would like internally. -- [[GWO]]

External links are a very good way of pointing to authorative reference material that supports facts in the article. -- [[User:Egil|Egil]] 09:01, 15 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Agreed, but I like to create shallow articles with links to more information ''from the article page itself, not /Talk'' with the intent that I or someone else will eventually follow that link and use it as a source to create a deeper Wikipedia article. Then the link can be relegated to a /Sources subpage. (Actually, on ''that'' subject, I prefer to cite my sources in the main article page.) ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[tbc]]''
----
Where one has written some wikipedia content by lifting facts from an external webpage then it is polite to reference that webpage. Perhaps just in a subpage called /Sources? --[[drj]]

:Yes, that seems reasonable. But steal the facts first... :) [[GWO]]

==IMDB etc.==

Somebody recently linked a movie (very unimportant, but that's not the point) to the site of [[IMDb]]. Nobody has seemed to mind. Simply nobody noticed? I think that, either the link
should be eliminated, or all the movies, acting professionals,
directors, etc. should be linked in that way. Probably the first
is true. The entry in question is [[:en:Miss Congeniality]]

:Actually, I'd prefer the latter. IMDb is a good, reliable source of accurate information, and unlikely to go away anytime soon. In fact, I think IMDb is the very archetype of the kind of site Wiki pages ''should'' be linking to. There's no reason not to link to it from every movie-related page (or, perhaps even better, link to a local Wiki page that redirects to it--this will require software support). External links are a good thing, so long as they are not to unreliable sites (like fan sites or time-dependent sites). --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

::That &quot;somebody&quot; would be me. Obviously I agree with LDC or I wouldn't have done it :-). I think it's redundant to have a Wikipedia article for ''any'' movie that ''doesn't'' include a link to the IMDb. If someone wants to write an original article, then let them do it. But don't try to reconstruct the IMDb facts. See [[:en:Crash (1996 film)]], for example. (Eeww, not that ''I'd'' want to ''see'' that movie.) ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[tbc]]''

:Actually, I disagree with the above a bit. External links are ''icing''; let's not leave out the cake. Yes, that means duplicating facts from IMDb. Duplication is good. Wikipedia should have complete and relevant articles. If it also links to external info, that's good too, but that doesn't mean the local article shouldn't have whatever data the author thinks is most important (for example, the local article should have the main actors and plotline; it's OK to leave thing like small bit-parts and cameos to IMDb). --LDC
----
I noticed the entry and chose not to comment on it. I think it should have at least a plot description (but, unlike the entry for [[:en:Fearless]], not a spoiler, or at least not one without a very clear warning). I prefer links as a supplement, not as the main content. This, in spite of my frequent contributions to various film pages and, more recently various [[:en:historical anniversaries]]... --KQ
----
Another couple points....
* particularly now that the Wikipedia content is easily downloadable for offline or other use, it's convenient to have the material available &quot;locally&quot; and licensed for any use
* distributed and duplicated content is good (if sometimes annoyingly inconsistent); for an extreme example, say *all* websites just linked to IMDb ... which was then permanently taken out by a major disaster, and backups were unavailable or faulty (yeah, I'm ignoring that Google and other sites have caches) ...
----
Recently I added an IMDB link as well, not knowing that there may be any doubts about it; and on cs:, I do it as a matter of course. In other words, I also agree with LDC. Distributed duplicated content is very fine, but it is a long-term goal; for now, I'm an inclusionist or slow-goer or whatever: you can't make anybody write a thorough page from nothing, or stolen facts. If the choice is, ''ceteris paribus'', between having a link to a site with more info than Wiki (currently) contains and not having it, there is no question what is more useful. --[[User:Maly ctenar|Maly ctenar]] 10:17, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)
----
I ran into a similar problem just now when adding to the [[en:Boudicca]] entry that she was the subject of two movies. Where there are ''no'' entries on Wikipedia on these films currently, it seems only logical to link to information about them elsewhere (pending, of course, Wiki articles on them). I would've created an internal link to new pages to encourage them being written, but I doubt that would happen any time soon, and anyone willing to author an entry on either film isn't likely to be influenced by whether they are simply referenced or referenced and given an external link to IMdB for those seeking more information. It also seems appropriate to link to IMdB as it was the reference I used for the spelling of titles and release years I included in the article itself, and in fact didn't even know the earlier movie existed before consulting IMdB. The unsurety I ran into, though, came with exactly where to include the links: as links off the mention of the movies? (this didn't seem right, as personally I'd expect a link in such format to be an internal link); as a footnote? (didn't seem right either, no real information about where it went, just the implication that it held info on the movie in question); as a separate piece of linked text following the mention of the movies? (also didn't seem right, a bit cluttered); or as an external link under the external links list? (problems of not being directly linked to the mention of the films and of taking up two spots in the external links list with links that aren't really about the subject as a whole). I decided to go with the latter, as it seemed the least offensive to those who might disagree.

However, I'd love to hear others' thoughts on the particular issue, including any other methods of linking the references on IMdB that I didn't think of. Also if anyone with more experience on Wikipedia wants to modify the listing, please feel free; my main concern was getting the information on there in one form or another. ~Bruce


===Non-neutral links===
Is there any policy about extremely non-neutral external links in the Wikipedia? If so, what is it? If not, one will have to make sure that articles with links to non-neutral sites should also have links to non-neutral sites representing opposing ideas. [[User:Marcos|Marcos]] 21:06, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:This has been my recent headache (see [[:en:Arthritis]] for a little &quot;link insertion war&quot;). There's ''nothing'' wrong with a POVed link, as long as the ''link description'' makes a clear statement which POV is represented (which is not immediately obvious). I have, for example, seperated the links under [[:en:Judaism]] to form categories, including one with criticisms. This makes immediately obvious which POV you'll see represented. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]] [[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T'''@'''lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 11:26, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)

You will see one approach on the [[:en:King-James-Only Movement]] page where a Pro and Con section has been created, each with it's own section of links. [[User:80.200.130.162|80.200.130.162]] 15:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

== Blog links: when? ==

In an article that I've been following/working on, someone added a link to a blog-style site (in the original ''weblog'' sense, a  journal of sites related to a particular topic or theme). This site kinda fits, because it does bring together a diversity of related sites that might be hard to locate otherwise. In that way, it adds to the value of this particular article. But, it's not a particularly comprehensive site (as far as I can tell after a quick look). And I think the link was placed to promote the blog site, and in turn that the blog site is a business (started as an information resource, hoping to capture traffic to presumably generate ad revenue). 

I guess this in part falls in [[fan site]] territory, but not exactly. If I'm not being clear, I'll...clarify! --[[User:24.244.220.229|24.244.220.229]] 14:58, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Blogs are rarely good sources for anything. It's mostly regurgitated stuff from places on the web with actual original content. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]] 05:08, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

Two points: 
# Blogs are often really good sources of information online. I don't know about your own browsing habits, but half of the sites I visit these days are &quot;blogs&quot;. And I'm talking about getting work done, not just browsing sites for fun. The term &quot;blog&quot; is very generic, and I would be wary to write off this very large, important, source of information online. 
# With regards to being concerned about linking to sites with revenue potential. There are fewer and fewer sites online that are not monetizing through some form of ads. Every major newspaper's site is flooded with ads, yet they are still a good source of reference. Community sites are often good places to link to from articles, and most of these will have advertising on them. You may have to give in sometime. 

Note: I realize that the case in question is more than likely a link to a less-than-useful blog that should have been removed. Still, I take offense to the &quot;blog prejudice&quot; and feel that high quality sites with advertising may become a problem if a policy of &quot;ads=no link&quot; remains enforced. Also, while a long time &quot;user&quot; of Wikipedia, I have only recently considered contributing. I am not very familiar with the Wikipedia culture. I appologize if I'm out of line here. Thanks. (Jason R. Coleman)

==Forums==
Forums are usually fan sites of different things/shows/movies/games whatever. At a Forum, you can chat about differen't things you like, you even have an Image for your avatar and signature. (If you use Mail.Yahoo, you'll know what type of &quot;Avatar&quot; I mean.) You can post threads and replies, sort of like a chat room, only it's much more organized.

Anyone, feel free to add on to this.

----

I am also curious about feelings on whether or not to link to message boards/forums.  Relevant discussion forums are clearly something Wikipedia does not offer, and something that many visitors would undoubtedly find interesting/useful.  So should related forums be linked to?  Sorry if this is discussed elsewhere, I haven't seen any guidelines on it yet.  Feel free to delete it if so (but leave a message on my talk, please.)

==WineLog.net Links==
(let me know if there is a better place to file this)
I am the Co-founder of WineLog.net. Our site is an open database of wines and wine information. The site is also a community for wine drinkers with ratings, reviews, and general commentary. 

'''Why Link to WineLog?'''
I know I'm biased on this, but I believe that links to WineLog would be very beneficial for browsers researching wine at Wikipedia. If I'm searching for Portuguese wine, what better link than one to a list of over 90 Portuguese wines (and growing). We have information, ratings, and reviews on over 8,000 wines.

The site currently has ads to subsidize hosting costs and other monetization efforts are in the works, but first and foremost the site is a resource for wine information and discussions. It's true that we might benefit from the links here, but why should that keep people from being exposed to our site? The argument would be similar to the one for IMDB above. I think it will be increasingly hard to find informative website without conflicts of interest presented by the inclusion of advertising on the sites.

'''Why External Links?'''
I agree and sympathize with the want to include information in the Wikipedia article itself rather than linking to an external resource. As our community and my own wine knowledge grows, I imagine I will be able to contribute to the already excellent wine knowledge that exists at Wikiepedia. However, because of the fluid and user-generated nature of the WineLog database, it makes more sense to link to our site as a resource for finding more information on wines.

I would ask that the editors review their decision to remove WineLog.net links. Please feel free to contact us at info@winelog.net. We would be very interested in working together with you to figure out what the best way would be for us to work with Wikipedia.

Thanks,

Jason Coleman

==Commercial Websites==

There are many websites listed in External Links or as Resources in the pages for any Place or City. Do the official websites of those Cities or Places are ok to list on the pages even if they are as much commercial as other non-official websites? or all commercial websites, whether they are offical or not, should be banned altogether? 

On another note, every website has to cover its cost somehow, even wikipedia needs it but not everyone can get donations to run the websites and server etc.

At the end of the day, IMO best criteria can only be the quality of the content &amp; relevancy. 

-Ali

==Personal sites==
I run a stargate fansite that has lots of info about the show.  Can I add a link to stagate-related pages?

I also have a Carry on film website, but even though i am a very popular website, some people seem to delete it? How can i get this linked if it keeps getting deleted

==Personal or Commercial?==
I am trying to write a wiki article on a humour-related website, and I feel I should link to what the article is talking about. However every time I attempt this, the entire article gets deleted. Is this because the website is technically commercial, since it is hosted by a commercial website?
--BoBoTheBum

== Table outdated ==

Are we really saying that there are only 2.6 million external links from Wikipedia's 3+ million articles?  Some articles have a dozen or more links.  If this table is not somehow auto-updated by a toolserver bot, then I see no value in listing a &quot;# of ELs&quot; or &quot;#ELs/#articles&quot; column.  Do I have agreement?  If so, then I'd support removing those columns after a period of discussion here; say, until November 1, 2009. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] 15:38, 9 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical}}
You know, I'm noticing that if I start from the homepage and just randomly follow links, I often end up at stub pages. I personally usually am paying attention to the RecentChanges page, where the bulk of the links are of course longer, more frequently edited pages; however, I can see how someone new to the project and not aware of RecentChanges might browse around, get frustrated at the stub pages, and justifiably conclude it is all just stub pages.

:The &quot;Featured article&quot; section of the main page gives newcomers great articles.

I'm not at all certain that this is a characteristic of the project that will necessarily diminish with time - I think it may be more due to the speed and ease of creating pages that are lists of topics, compared with the time and difficulty required to make just a few content-ful pages. For example, in the time it takes one person to write a decent article about Nebraska, another person can create a listing of 20 towns in the state with matching &quot;stub&quot; pages. I am wondering if we may be &quot;stuck&quot; with having a large proportion of stub pages, just due to the way wikipedia works, no matter how far along wikipedia is?

:But isn't that the nature of all human knowledge? The bigger Wikipedia grows, the bigger its borders with unknown become.

For example, browse [[w:Language]]. Nice list, but only a handful of the items are filled in, and not many of the filled in ones have much detail. Or [[w:Agriculture]], [[w:History]], [[w:Cooking]], [[w:Politics]] (now much improved), [[w:History of Science and Technology]], [[w:Hobby]], [[w:Music]], [[w:Sport]]... Yes, these are very nice, reasonably complete lists of topics, all of which would be nice to have articles on, and yes there are some adequate articles (and a few _great_ articles) in there, but by and large these pages scream &quot;WIKIPEDIA IS MISSING LOTS OF INFO!&quot;
:Since this was written, the edit links in the Languages article have been filled in. 

If this is true, then it could be a difficult criticism to shake.  I think up until now, these pages have served a very useful purpose, because wikipedia's structure was geared more towards the aim of gathering _writers_, not gathering readers. Writers NEED incomplete lists; readers need complete ones. But I would argue that we have plenty of writers, and that to get more, we want to shift Wikipedia towards the users. And that means we need to look more complete.

Two ideas spring to mind for how we can address this.

The first idea is cultural. Simply encourage the creation of longer pages over shorter ones. Adopt the stance of &quot;No page is better than a stub page&quot; and discourage people from creating a new topic unless they're willing to write at least a full paragraph on it, and definitely start discouraging the creation of more empty lists. Also, adopt practices that give positive encouragement to people who create long articles or greatly fill in stubs - this was one of my objectives with Wikipedia_NEWS, before we got so overwhelmed with traffic that I gave up updating it and just started writing long articles myself. :-)

I know the idea of discouraging stubs runs counter to some of the essays and policies on the site, so I understand this would take significant mulling-over and might not be acceptable, but I think this approach needs to be considered.

The second idea is more direct and radical: Encourage deletion of empty lists. Lists are not *that* valuable; as mentioned above, we can count on people creating many more such lists, quickly and easily compared with creating the more desireable lengthy pages. Only leave the few links that already have significant material attached. The absence of empty lists will give added weight to the filled in articles, for the first-time visitor. Or if nothing else, weed out some of the unfilled links, to bring the proportion of &quot;long pages&quot; to stub or unfilled pages to at least 50%.

As an example, consider the pages [[w:Archaeology]], [[w:Transport]], and [[w:Computer Science]], which even though as lists they are incomplete, the fact that the majority of the items in the lists actually have filled in pages (and many of them quite lengthy) makes these pages *look* a lot more complete. And of course it's *easy* for someone to add a new topic onto the Computer Science page when they have something to write on.

One argument in favor of keeping long lists of empty topics is that it &quot;gives plenty of openings to encourage people to write about&quot;. Agreed, however we have a disproportionate amount of empty topics listed, and it's going to make the user very frustrated, and even if we got rid of 90% of them, we'd still have plenty of empty links for people to write on.

----
What do you think of my rendering of [[w:politics]]? In case it's not still there,
I moved the non-completed links to [[w:Politics/Wanted]], and put a plea on
that page for authors to write those articles and move them to the main page
when they're more than just stubs.

For authors, there's now a useful list of articles to be completed.
For readers, they get links only to the completed articles.

--DanKeshet

:Wow, that looks a lot cleaner, plus it provides the same &quot;articles needed&quot; info as before. I like it. -- BryceHarrington

----
Like we have [[w:Requested articles]], we could list stub articles on a [[w:Fill these stubs]] page. I might put an automatic &quot;stubs&quot; list on my PHP wiki. --[[w:Magnus Manske]]
:I think this is a fantastic idea. I don't know where you come up with all these ideas, Magnus. :-) I think it's a ''great'' idea for us, those of us who care, to constantly be adding stub articles to a central page-o-stubs, and make it our mission in life to destubify them. --LMS
----
I have a third suggestion (I've been thinking about this a bit lately): some of us should concentrate our efforts on our &quot;portal&quot; articles, the catagories that are listed on the front page. Ideally, they should all serve as an extensive overview to a topic ([[w:Philosophy]] is currently pretty good). Personally, I'll be working on a [[w:Communication Studies]] article over the next little while. If other people could pick one of the portal pages they know something about, we can thread the web a little better. -- [[w:STG]]
:I totally agree here, too. It seems to me I once kvetched about that. :-) --LMS
:I too agree. Since people just &quot;clicking into&quot; the site will hit the portal pages first, making sure each of those pages are good and long would help a lot (and thankfully there's only about 50-60 such pages, so is a doable endeavor even for 1-2 people). -- BryceHarrington
:I've just finished working on [[w:Geography]]. It had originally been just a couple sentences and then a list of (mostly empty) geographical terms, and I expanded it with a more detailed description of geography as a science. Could it be true that the portal pages are less provocative and less interesting to work on because they're so generic, and people prefer working on specific topics? -- BryceHarrington

Just my own little two cents worth -- one reason that no stub page is better than a stub page is that no page generates a question mark after the term when mentioned elsewhere, which is an admission that we don't have the information, and a &quot;teaser&quot; to all of us who can't resist the urge to write. :-) Whereas a stub page satisfies our thirst *just a little bit*, which perhaps doesn't encourage authors nearly as much.

Whenever we are issuing forth propaganda about the site, we should never use a count of articles that includes stub pages. It's much stronger to say that we have 8,000 articles longer than 100 words (or whatever metric we like), than to say we have 15,000 articles, but who knows how long they are.

--[[w:Jimbo Wales]]

:Or the proverbial &quot;500 word essay&quot;? ;-) Btw, very good point regarding having no stub page might be more of a teaser. For me, at least, there's a certain enjoyment in the initial creation of a topic, that I don't get if a stub's already been put there. I've no idea if others feel this way tho. -- BryceHarrington

:I get enjoyment from creating stubs. :-) Honestly, I think that something ''is'' better than nothing. The question mark placeholders give me the message that ''no one'' cares about the article; at least when it's filled in with a hyperlink I can tell that at least ''one'' person cares about the topic. So what if they only create a stub? I see no significant difference between being the initial author of an article and being the first author to replace a stub with something substantial. ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[w:tbc]]''
----
Generally, I'm not really sure how to think about this. There are a number of different issues here, some of which are unresolved in my head, so I don't know what to think.

I agree, stubs suck and they make Wikipedia look bad. On the other hand, stubs represent content that someone was willing to donate, and why should we discourage people from contributing what they can? That seems to work against the very source of our activity. But, on the [[w:gripping hand]], maybe Jimbo is right--maybe having the question mark is more provocative. I just don't know. Who really knows how people are thinking about this, short of doing some sort of study? One might just as easily say that the question marks, if there are many of them, overwhelm people by showing them ''how much'' there is to do. At least a stub article is a start, even if it's a pathetic start.

If some of us make it our mission in life to build [[w:Fill these stubs]] and then to do as the title says, I think we won't need to set any specific rules which might discourage people from participating.

I think [[w:Wikipedia/Our Replies to Our Critics]] will help at least somewhat to dispel the notion that Wikipedia is lightweight because it contains a lot of stubs.

Jimbo's suggestion that we advertise an even more restricted set of articles, as the ones we're willing to take credit for, will help a lot too. On the &quot;what number should we use to advertise our number of articles&quot; question, I'll post something on [[w:Malcolm Farmer/How many Wikipedia pages are there]]. --[[w:LMS]]

:Yes, stub articles is a start, and I agree this is hard to think about because it's been our policy for so long that even minor stub pages are okay. But listening to the outside commentary we've been getting lately makes me think the stubs are doing us a disservice. I'm taking an intentially provocative stance in the above essay to stimulate thinking and am betting that others can help find less radical solutions that are still effective. Working on the portal pages, for instance, I think would do a lot of good. Or as another example, maybe we don't need to *discourage* stubs (and certainly we shouldn't berate people for making them) but perhaps we could just make it abundantly clear in the newbie docs that one should put something *meaningful* on a new page, at least a full paragraph. On the other hand, we discourage mere dictionary definitions already, for example, so maybe we could make a clear stance...

:Regarding making a mission to fill in stubs - well certainly this is going to necessary, but please note that the growth of stub pages can greatly exceed our ability to fill them. So we need to slow that growth so we can catch up.

:[[w:Wikipedia/Our Replies to Our Critics]] might answer some of the concerns about the lightweightness, but note that anyone who browses around enough to find that *particular* article will probably have run across some other stub pages. What we're concerned with is the many people who are looking to make a quick judgment by just link clicking from the main page. We want them to make the quick judgment that Wikipedia Has Lots Of Good Stuff, and dive in to find more.

:Btw, thanks for giving this some thought! I've got confidence that you'll help guide us to a good solution. :-)

: -- BryceHarrington

I wonder if there's an automatic way to search for articles that are ''smaller'' than a certain size! Even if not, it might be easier to program such a search than to create and maintain a [[w:fill these stubs]] page by hand.

I'll try to put links to the reply-to-critics page prominently in several places (the welcome page and the FAQ, at the very least). --LMS

Hmm, good idea. Here's code to do it:

First thing, nuke all the empty pages that just say &quot;Describe the new page...&quot;

  mkdir /tmp/emptypages
  cd [....]/wiki/lib-http/db/wiki/html
  for file in `find . -type f -size -1400c \! -name '*[&quot;]*' -print | \
    xargs grep 'Describe the new page here.' | cut -d: -f1`
  do
    mv $file /tmp/emptypages
  done

Review and delete the stuff in /tmp/emptypages at your convenience.

Now for the fun part

  cd [....]/wiki/lib-http/db/wiki/html
  for file in `find . -type f -size -1800c -print`; do ls -ol $file; done

This one gets a listing of all the pages which have fewer than about 500 characters worth of content. Knock the number up or down depending on where you wish to draw the line.

-- BryceHarrington

   Won't this delete redirect pages as well?

&lt;hr&gt;
Well, I'm an admitted newbie, but I really like stub pages. I have a wide range of knowledge, but shallow in most areas not related to science or computers. I also tend to have a short attention span (blame video games). I think it's kinda neat to just cruise around Wikipedia and add stuff where I can.

For example, I happened across the diesel engine page. At the time, it only had about 2 sentences of info. I'm not an expert on these engines, and I'm not going to write a long treatise on their history, design, and operation. But I knew slightly more about them than what was currently exisiting on the page, so I added it. Someone else came along later and added more. Someone else editied it to make more sense. Now it's a decent entry, though by no means completely comprehensive.

But the process is cool. The process is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;... at least for guys like me.

Some people don't want to take 2 hours (or more) to write a decent-length essay. I think Wikipedia needs every little bit it can get, as long as it is correct.

-- [[w:Ansible/Talk|ansible]]
----
The exact minimum length for a starter page (if you can't write a substantial amount anyway...) would seem to be just enough content to start a fight. Nobody wrote anything in the [[w:Java programming language]] unti I started it, then people ripped that sucker apart with new content. It would seem that many people are much more comfortable adding a to (or disagreeing with) a page than creating one, so if we can pique people's interest with a single paragraph, thats all for the better.

Perhaps to facilitate something like this, if you have something to add to a nonexisting page, add it. but also add some skeleton structure to facilitate other people adding trivia easily, because they see a place for it.

Dictionary definition==bad, enough to build on==good.

--[[w:Alan D]]

If you must write stubs (and of course you must! Do it! You know you want to!) see [[w:the perfect stub article]] for a few suggested guidelines. --[[w:LMS]]

----
I do have to respectfully disagree with the main premise of this article. We all have random facts, figures and info in each one of our heads. Quite often the knowledge we have is not enough to start off an article with a proper definition (that is, a good stub). However, if someone went to the trouble to try to synthesize something into a one line definition, then anyone can then input their random info about the topic and therefore expand the stub into an article. This, along with an improved &quot;find and fix a stub&quot; utility, and following Larry's &quot;perfect stub&quot; criteria should work. [[user:maveric149|maveric149]]  


I have seen some stubs gradually grow into good articles, and I have had several very enjoyable sessions of ''Stub Tennis'' with other Wikipedians. This is a crucial part of Wikipedia's strength: it isn't just peer review, it's collaboratively written.  -- [[user:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 

----

&quot;The second idea is more direct and radical: Encourage deletion of empty lists. Lists are not *that* valuable&quot;.

Speaking personally, I feel the author's views (legitimately) express a frustration that Wiki is not yet complete; but I feel that frustration at its incompleteness should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; manifest itself in the form of 'drawing a line in the sand' and cleaning up the database with the intention of throwing it open to a wider viewing audience. 

As long as Wiki exists, part of its &lt;i&gt;raison d'etre&lt;/i&gt; is to &lt;b&gt;encourage&lt;/b&gt; people to play a part in it. This also means stressing the areas which are not adequately covered, in the hope of encouraging somebody to play a part. If all Wiki's weak areas were reduced to articles with no links to even stubs, then there is no incentive for knowledgable people to contribute - strangers may not even realise they have the opportunity to contribute.

The presence of stubs encourages people to fill in the information they themselves know. Explicitly deleting those stubs in the vague hope that somebody will one day create them anyway is virtually an anathema to me. -- [[user:xneilj|xneilj]]

:Just for correctness sake, this is ''Wikipedia''. &quot;Wiki&quot; can be found [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors here]. [[Wikipedia is not Wiki]].

:I think we need to differentiate from stub pages (which are very short articles) from junk pages (which have zero or very close to zero useful information in them). If a page is created that has a decent one-line definition then we should rejoice that somebody has started that subject and then ''add'' to it. But if some creates an article for [[Somewhere, Some State]] and the only content is &quot;'''Somewhere''' is a city in [[Some State]].&quot; then that should be deleted because it has zero information in it that cannot be obtained from the title. Of course random junk (such as aflkjal;kfjds;al) or vandal-created pages whose content is &quot;This is so gay&quot; should also be deleted on-sight. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

:: There's also a distinction between temporary stubs and permanent stubs. Temporary stubs can grow reasonably quickly into proper articles (though they may not, by quirk of contributors). Permanent stubs either can not do that, or will not do that. Examples: obscure characters from the Simpsons or Atlas Shrugged. (more controversial example: obscure people who died in 9/11). I still think merging is the best solution to permanent stubs. [[User:MyRedDice|MyRedDice]]

Duhhh, this is so cut and dried its not funny - MBTI 101
J's hate stubs
P's love them

----
I dont know if this suggestion is practical, or useful or even new, but what comes to my mind is: '''why can't we use another color on the links which are directed to stub pages?''' Of course it would require that &quot;everyone&quot; uses the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;-command when appropiate, but then the newbies would, I believe, rather quickly learn that following those links are not going to give 'much' useful information - and they won't be as &quot;scared&quot;, which I understand is one of the main reasons to dislike the stubs. What do you think? Much work to implement this? [[User:Mikez|Mikez]] 19:11, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:You can already change the colour of links to stub articles. Change the ''Threshold for stub display'' setting in your preferences. See [[MediaWiki User's Guide: Setting preferences]]. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 23:45, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)
::Thanks for the info. But when considering the discussion above, maybe such a threshold should as default be a non-zero number? At least for those &quot;newbies&quot; who are not logged in.

['''bold''' emphasis added by Stephen Brooks, as he thinks this is a good idea.  Have levels of 'missing', 'stub' and 'complete article', the first two of which come with a sort of warning.]

----

I'd just like to say that stubs are not bad. It is you people who sit complaining about them that is. the lack of sensitivaty is reasonably understandable, but if they seem to pick your bone so why dont you do something about them instead of constantly bickering about how the seemingly &quot;stupid stubs&quot; and go searching for one on a topic you are interested in exploring. This would give you something to do other than complain, and you could further expand your brains. 

-------


What's wrong with stubs? I hate pages where people just go on and on about the same topic. we, as a people, should not have to sit in front of a computer for 10 minutes, straining our eyes to read tiny print,  only to get a little information about a topic. I know some topics have a lot of stuff about them, but people need to get to the point. I think there should be a limit as to how long a page is, not how short. Kill the fancruft pages!!

if you kill the stubs, the wiki proyect is never going to grow.
--------------------
I think one problem with stub-killing can be seen in Wik/de.  Short articles are rapidly deleted, not because they are wrong but, in effect, because they are stubs.  Consequently, there are all sorts of h les in Wik/de.  If people are concerned about links to stubs frustrating people, then here is a suggestion to fix that up:  make a different designation for such links, e.g., color them green or have the word stub or a symbol for it in place by the linked word. - kdammers of wikipedia.

In my commentary on [[/Kill the Stub Pages]] it was mentioned that just improving the second tier pages alone would go a long way towards resolving the issue. I've been thinking on this for a while and figured I'd toss out my ideas.

Those of us who were here at the beginning of Wikipedia will remember how the original homepage was a rather hopeless mishmash of links. I remember getting so annoyed with it that one day I totally redid it (to several people's horror), using an [[Wikipedia category schemes|organizational scheme]] used by Jefferson and the original Library of Congress. It was almost immediately reverted, but I think my point was made that improvement was required. This kicked off a long sequence of revisions, reorganizations, philosophizing over the proper structure, and polishing. Finally, we have a homepage which is actually reasonably decently organized.

Wikipedia has grown considerably, and many lower level, specific entries are being contributed daily. Unfortunately, for some reason the pages immediately off of the homepage (which we term &quot;Portal Pages&quot;) are lacking. Some are very good. Many are a hopeless mishmash of links. Others mere stubs. Most look more like outlines or indexes than like encyclopedia pages. Few of them share any sense of consistency. Like our original homepage, they serve as a starting point, but we can do *much* better.

Like the homepage, it is important for us to have a philosophy of what a portal page is for, and a structure for how to organize it. But I would submit that a portal page has significantly different requirements than the homepage, and should not be considered *just* an extension of it. Therefore, I would put forth the following objective for portal pages: &quot;A portal page should assist the reader in finding information on common topics relevant to or related to the subject under examination.&quot; It is a subject page, not just a listing of random links, yet it is also a stepping point rather than a destination - it must provide a good set of links into other meaty pages.

How does this differ from the principles used on the homepage? The homepage seeks to provide as many jumping off points as possible within the shortest amount of screen space. It seeks to organize these links in a way that makes it simple to find which section you're interested in. It does not explain the topics. A portal page on the other hand, does not need to follow the screen space limit, nor is organization *quite* as key, however explanation and description is more vital. It needs to provide enough surrounding information to help the reader quickly figure out a) whether this portal page is likely to have a link appropriate to their needs, b) it needs to educate about what each link is and how it relates to the others and to the topic itself, and c) it should dependably give the user *useful* subpages, not just tease them with stub pages (pages with less than a paragraph of text). Thus an ideal portal page would be more verbosely wordy than the homepage. On the other hand, it needs to balance its prose so that it is not overwhelming the links with text.

Portal pages are intended for the general reader moreso than for writers and editors; we know these people all have their eye on the Recent Changes page. ;-) But I think a reader-oriented portal page serves writers too, as it provides a consistent way for them to navigate to &quot;the front lines&quot;.

I also think it is worth our while to make all of the portal pages look consistent. They should have a similar layout and structure. Why? Three reasons: First it makes us look more organized as a project and thus makes Wikipedia seem more &quot;professional&quot;. Second because it will make Wikipedia marginally more useful to end users, because they will know what to expect from each of the links off of the homepage. And third and finally because it sets a standard for other editors to follow with the third and Nth-tier pages.

Using the above rationale, here is an initial proposal for some suggested guidelines and objectives to follow when developing a portal page:

* The portal page must *describe* the subject. This *is* an encyclopedia after all. The Chemistry page needs to explain what Chemistry is - not simply give a dictionary definition and a list of links. It needn't give a thorough, academically accurate elaboration, but at least a couple paragraphs that would introduce it to the lay user. Avoid overuse of jargon. Longer definitions could be linked to via relevant topic pages. Pepper the description text amply with links to the appropriate topics, if those topic pages hold sufficient detail and are relevant to the subject.
* A history of the subject should be given. But keep it brief; elaborations on a few particular periods in the subject's history should be put on their own pages and linked to, when those pages are mature enough to be worth reading. Shoot for a paragraph or two.
* Key or example figures in the subject who have good meaty topic pages about them should be mentioned (perhaps in the history or descriptive sections), but there is no need for elaboration - just link to their bio page. Again, avoid turning the portal page into a biographical index; just indicate half a dozen relevant people who have good wikipedia pages (and maybe a few key figures who don't have a decent page but should - but again remember we're trying to guide the reader towards *useful* information.)
* You should give a listing of good pages in that section, but needn't have *every* possible link. These do not need to be comprehensive indexes (instead provide links to relevant index pages), but should give a sampling. Group the links into a few categories, each containing 5-10 items in that categoriy that could be considered &quot;popular&quot; topics people will be looking for (e.g., on the Geography page, rather than list every country, perhaps list the USA, Russia, China, Afghanistan, and maybe a couple others, and then just link to the Countries of the World page for more.) Look at the [[Mathematics]] page for a good example of how this can be done. If there are alternate organizational schemes, set up a subpage called /Schemes to hold them.
* Include just a small number of &quot;potential topics&quot; - topics that are unfilled or are just stubs. By having a few it honestly admits that this is a work in progress, and suggests &quot;Your help is desired!&quot; yet too many unfilled links will convey the message that Wikipedia is woefully incomplete. We want to emphasize our best bits to our readers and reviewers, after all - and that's what they want too! Consider placing lists of empty but desired (or stubbed) links onto a /Wanted subpage.
* Avoid external links. After all we want them to use _wikipedia_, not shuttle them off to some other site. Plus, there is always a chance that those links will go away (affectionately called &quot;link rot&quot;). One or two are probably fine, if they provide good detailed information and look like they'll be around for a while, but if there are more than that, consider leaving them on the /References subpage.
* Portal pages should not merely crosslink to other portal pages (look at Performing Arts for a particularly bad example) - if this is all that they're doing, then they are redundant and may be an unnecessary layer. Ask yourself if you were searching for a particular topic, would you go to this page? (E.g., if you were looking for a page on &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; would you go to the [[Performing Arts]] link or just click on [[Theater and Drama]]?) Portal Pages seek to assist the reader in finding the information they're looking for quickly, not implement an academically perfect information hierarchy.
* References and Further Reading can be given, but if there are more than three or four items, consider making a separate bibliography page for them.

As mentioned above, standardizing the look and feel of the portal pages is important, however I'm not going to propose a template to follow; I think this needs a lot of discussion to achieve a concensus, and will take time to work out. However, some of the portal pages have already received ample deliberation on regarding their structure and appearance, and I'll point them out: [[Mathematics]] is well rounded and pretty close to idea. [[Politics]] has excellent sections of links, but the history and descriptive parts need elaboration.
[[Philosophy]] is getting close and seems to have most of the desired elements but needs a bit more refactoring as its rather rambly right now, [[Games]] has a very clean organization to its link list but is too short, [[Religion]] has a very clean organization but is too long and needs a history section, [[Opera]] has a good intro and list of key figures. There might be other good pages; I extracted this list from just a quick browse over the portal pages.

I think we may want to establish a list of &quot;standard&quot; subpages, such as /Talk, /References, /Wanted, /Schemes, etc. We'll want to establish a standard look for headers, organizing link lists (e.g., bullet lists with one item per line vs single lines with dash-separated links), and how dense to pepper descriptive and historical prose with links to topic pages.

God, is Bryce ever right that our portal pages have to be improved. Most of them are appallingly bad compared to the best of the articles that they link to. We really should put some serious Wikipedia time in improving them. This is bound to make Wikipedia look lots better. --[[LMS]]

[[Magnus Manske]], hopefully with the help of others, is writing a new [[PHP]] version of the WikiWiki software that runs Wikipedia.

I think we should completely eliminate the use of subpages in this new software. I think we should rename pages presently named [[foo/bar]] to [[foo--bar]]. Frankly, I am sick and tired of subpages. I hate them. I feel more strongly than ever that the arguments I made in [[Why_I_am_suspicious_of_subpages]], [[Accidental_linking_and_hard-wired_category_schemes]], and [[The_case_against_subpages]]. I also don't really feel that those pages together make the best possible case against subpages; more can be said.

Subpages would be nice, I suppose, for other namespaces, like the Wikipedia namespace and the User namespace. I just hate the idea of continuing to use them for the article namespace.

What do you all think of this?

--[[Larry Sanger]]

:personally, I see no practical difference and only a very slight aesthetic difference in using &quot;--&quot; as a subtopic delimiter rather than &quot;/&quot;. But as long as I'm not the one doing the work changing everything over, I guess there's no harm. -[[Bryan Derksen|BD]]

:It seems as if subpages like Talk make sense (I like Visitors on personal pages); or even subpages like this one. But in general I think they should either be supported at unlimited levels (which would be very strange, I know, and to work right would really require a moderator to tell people where to put things) or at no level at all. Perhaps there should be only a few named subpages allowed, so it's not possible to make up new ones? Like Talk, Work, Suggestions (Politics?) - all stuff pertaining directly to the mechanics/politics of the article in question. - justfred

:I like that suggestion: in the main namespace, allow Talk pages only (maybe also a Bibliography or Additional Sources). In the other namespaces like &quot;User:&quot; we can allow subpages with different names, and maybe we should come up with a separate namespace for entries about wikipedia, allowiing subpages under other names. And I'd like not to have dashes in the titles, either, unless the title of the object calls for a colon (which isn't allowed, e.g. ''Samurai 1: Musashi Miyamoto'') (or, for that matter, a slash, which would imply a subpage, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;''Face/Off''&lt;/nowiki&gt;). That is, I would much prefer to see &lt;nowiki&gt;[[United States/Government]] converted to [[government of the United States]] instead of [[United States--government]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It just allows for more accidental linking and actually fits the way a person would say it. --[[KQ]]

The idea of changing / to -- borders, in my opinion, on irrational. It's just a character, after all; if you want to grant it power of hierarchy creation, '--' can be invested with this power just as well as '/'.

I'm strongly in favour of subpages. In my opinion, virtually none of the arguments against them have strong merit. The most important argument against them (creating undesirable hierarchy, making B son of A when B may have independent interest or may just as well be considered the son of C) is actually the argument against improper subpaging. There're plenty of cases in which B '''has''' no independent interest - /Talk pages, long lists broken by first letters alphabetically, alternative treatments of the same topic or in-depth look at one aspect of the issue, too long to be put on the main page.

All the other arguments against subpages besides this one are much less relevant, in my opinion, than Larry thinks simply because '''subpages are also pages'''. Subpages are pages: they can be linked to just as well as regular pages. Example: in case [[Hebrew language//Phonology]] needs to be linked to from a general page on phonology, it can be linked to there, and changing it to [[Phonology of Hebrew]] isn't going to make the slightest bit of difference w.r.t. the link from the phonology page. Or, in general: B is a subpage of A; for instance, because B has no independent interest, but merely elaborates upon the aspect X of A. Now if there's a page devoted to the aspect X, it can link to A/B just as easily as it can link to &quot;X of A&quot;. The link is not worse off because it points to a subpage. And generally, in all cases when the subpage should be treated as an separare entity, we can just ignore the slash aspect of it and treat its name as one large string. What I'm trying to explain here is that we let the hierarchical aspect matter in precisely the degree we '''want''' it to matter, and not more than that.

So what are subpages? They're just like regular pages, and '''in addition''' to that they also establish themselves as inherent parts of their &quot;father&quot; pages, too long or inconvenient to be included wholly inside the &quot;father&quot; page. '''That's the only difference''' between subpages and regular pages. And the only problem with this difference may arise when this relation is inappropriate, and there're certainly many cases when it is. Now on the other hand consider the '''benefits''' of this '''additional''' relation, this added information between pages.

One huge benefit is simply the fact that this relationships binds pages much more tightly than a mere link. Page A may link to 12 other pages, and we have no way of saying, simply and unequivocally, to the reader: hey, by far the most important among these 12 links is the link to B. The subpage mechanism lets us make this point simply and forcefully.

The other benefit of course is precisely our ability to link to subpages.


Could write more about this, but am feeling too damn tired now.

--[[AV]]

:&quot;The idea of changing / to -- borders, in my opinion, on irrational. It's just a character, after all; if you want to grant it power of hierarchy creation, '--' can be invested with this power just as well as '/'.&quot;

But what about the suggestion that we not use -- at all except as a substitute for / or : since the first creates a subpage (whose title wouldn't be allowed) and the second isn't allowed in links.

:If you use -- as a substitute for /, you gain absolutely nothing. Right now / has the associative power of a subpage, and then -- will have that power. Nothing will change. That's my point.

And again you have missed my point: don't use -- at all, except as a substitute in a title that would have required a / or : (and use it then only because the : is illegal and the / would be too since it would denote a subpage by a name that would not be allowed).

So far as your other comments go, you do have a point that the problem is incorrect subpaging; my question for you is how you would enforce only ''correct'' subpaging? It can't be done. --[[KQ]]

:We enforce it in the same way we enforce everything else here - by editing. How do we enforce NPOV, correct titles, proper spelling, good organisation of material and everything else? By editing. You see a subpage that'd be better off as an independent page - move it. --[[AV]]

::(by editing AND by explaining and showing examples on the proper guidance pages!)

It's not simply a matter of having it be on the correct subpage. That would be a (very big) problem in itself; but the hierarchy itself is a problem too. Why &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Spain/History]]? Why not [[History/Spain]]? Why [[Film editing/Star wipe]]? Why not [[Post-production effects/Star wipe]]?&lt;/nowiki&gt; I think you're assuming a greater knowledge than you or anyone has: a term can always be used in an unforeseen context, so why not avoid imposing any hierarchy on it that will eventually come to be seen as arbitrary?

One example of subpages that I rather like is [[Mercury]] and its various divisions. If I weren't so lazy and relatively new to Wikipedia, I would break up other multi-entry pages into subpages like this rather than listing all the entries in the same page. As for less clearly defined subpages like the Spain/History and History/Spain thing, why not have both and employ redirects? Assuming there's some sort of master History page where it would make sense to list various countries under separate subpages, of course. -[[Bryan Derksen|BD]]
---------
I would support dropping subpages. I know '--' vs. '/' is just an aesthetic thing, but I like '--' because it looks a bit more traditional for an encyclopedia. The other advantage of '--' is changing the subpaging character might cause a change in attitude to subpages, since the new character would not have the associations the old one has developed.

'/' is actually written into the Wikipedia software; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/X]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; creates a link to &lt;nowiki&gt;Wikipedia commentary/X&lt;/nowiki&gt;, not just to &lt;nowiki&gt;/X&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Whether we use &quot;/&quot; or &quot;--&quot; or anything else for subpages, I think it should be treated as a normal character. -- [[Simon J Kissane]]
--------
I vote that subpages should be kept, since they are a good thing if used properly - for instance /Talk, /Alternate, /Old, and /Bibliograpy. It's convenient not to have to link back to the article every time one of these is created, or to be able to reference the alternate version on talk without having to re-type the article's name. I'll agree that trying to create a hierarchy with them is bad, but that something can be misused is not an argument to get rid of it, or else none of wikipedia would be left!
--[[Josh Grosse]]

How freakishly ironic is a subpage that calls for the elimination of subpages?

I'm a strong supporter of subpages; see [[/Modular content creation]], [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]].
--TheCunctator
----
The only difference between ''&lt;nowiki&gt;page/subpage&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''page--anotherpage'' is that the second could be used to make infinite levels of subpages: ''page--anotherpage--stillanother--...'' Our current subpages system is limited, as it should be, and I think we should keep it. Actually, the -- pages are a personal pet peave of mine...--[[STG]]
-----
Using subpages as a means to organize content is in most cases a form of laziness. Articles should be written well enough that their relationships with other articles are clear; for instance putting [[Nobel Prize/Economics]] is just an excuse to add a (non-encyclopedic) list of people and dates without writing an article about them. The same goes for all those [[Academy Awards]] pages. An article which is written well will not need to be on a subpage. Replacing / with -- is a senseless compromise; leave /Talk and kill all the rest. It looks sloppy because it is.
----
Since my PHP script is the cause of this discussion, I should say that the script supports a &quot;talk:&quot; namespace for each topic. So, Talk:HomePage would be the talk &quot;subpage&quot; of HomePage. No need to keep subpages just because of the /Talk thing. --[[Magnus Manske]]
----
I thought I liked subpages, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that I don't like them. I should say that I don't like the way the software handles subpages -- of course conceptually breaking down a large topic into components is a good thing in many cases. For example, [[Ben Franklin/Childhood]] is a good idea for a conceptual subpage, but it should be named something that better facilitates accidental linking, and also that is more readable: [[Ben Franklin's Childhood]].

Really, there's no limitation on the organization of content that is imposed by eliminating subpages.

I do like the idea of treating all /Talk pages differently, as well as perhaps a few other types of pages. The reason is that those pages are different, they are non-encylopedia articles.

Imagine this, for example: /Bibliography can lead to a page that is editable in the &quot;Wiki spirit&quot; but which has structured fields for people to add references. In the present scheme, subpages are just pages. In a new scheme, subpages can be *special* as necessary. --Jimbo

----
I'm one of the largest (ab?)users of subpages here, and I have to say that I'm only using them because Wiki doesn't have some features I'd rather see, like parenthesized titles (planned) and &quot;link contexts&quot; (not planned). With those features, I wouldn't miss them a bit. --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

I'm not opposed to parenthized titles -- indeed, I was only converted against subpages today. But it occurs to me that one principle of page naming is trying to guess how other authors might accidentally link the page. Of course, that in turn depends on where they expect a link to succeed. But surely [[Ben Franklin's childhood]] is more natural than [[Ben Franklin (Childhood)]]? Maybe not. I'm just thinking this through.

Ick! No, you're not. Perentheses are used to clarify ''context'': &quot;Benjamin Franklin's Childhood&quot; is the right title. We need parentheses for things like &quot;Turkey (Country)&quot; and &quot;Turkey (Bird)&quot;. Likewise &quot;Mapping (Mathematics)&quot; and &quot;Deposition (Law)&quot;. Similarly, some means of specifying the link context of a page, so that for example, on other Law pages one can make a link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[deposition]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and expect it to go to the right place, rather than to &quot;Depostion (Chemistry)&quot; or to an intermediate page. --LDC

[[Ben Franklin/Childhood]] will automatically link to the Ben Franklin page. [[Ben Franklin's Childhood]] would not - people might see this page and think our Ben Franklin page is bizarrely only about his childhood. The automatic linking is a powerful feature of subpages. - Tim


But it's still relatively ''easy'' to make that link back; the article will almost certainly start &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Ben Franklin]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; grew up in ...&quot;. The downside of the subpage is that it ''forces'' the automatic link; it doesn't give you any choice about it, whether it's appropriate or not, or where to put it. I think it is critical to make sure that it's easy to create good pages; it should also be more difficult to create bad ones. --LDC
----
Again: the onus is on those who want to eliminate a feature to show what the alternative will be. So, please tell me what in the new system will become of:
# Pages like this very one (a subpage that advocates eliminating subpages)
# Entries like [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]&lt;br&gt;
--TheCunctator
----
Actually, I have a better suggestion than renaming / pages to -- pages. Just let all the pages keep their present names, and remove the / functionality (the / becomes just another character). Then, the answers to your questions above, Cunctator, are obvious. --[[LMS]]

:Larry, what do you suppose the / functionality is '''now''' (besides creating a special link to the &quot;parent&quot; page which is a '''good''' thing). What is there to remove? --[[AV]]
::Actually, there are two more functionalities (I know, I re-wrote them;) : The ability to say &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Talk]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[This long topic/Talk]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and the limitation to one subpage level. On the PHP wiki, there's some more, like the display of all subpages of the main page of the current article in a &quot;QuickBar&quot; thingy (looks like &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikipedia commentary&lt;br&gt;Wikipedia commentary/Talk&lt;br&gt;Wikipedia commentary/Get rid of subpages entirely&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; and so on). --[[Magnus Manske]]

:::And again, all these look like good things to me. The QuickBar thingie is especially good as it creates the impression of the overall unity when visiting the main page, while a subpage still remains a fully featured page for all purposes (except it can't have subpages ;)) and can't be linked to separately.

:::BTW, I think it might be a good idea to allow for second-level subpages, but limit them to /Talk only. --[[AV]]

::::Most of the effects are psychological/wikicultural, but they're no less real and important (and detrimental) for that. Read my essays and see if you can reply to them.

:::::If the effects are psychological/wikicultural (which I agree they are), what does your suggestion of &quot;removing the / functionality&quot; ''mean''? As for essays, I read them all carefully, and presented many reasons as to why subpages are good and worth keeping, some of them are spelled out extensively near the beginning on this page. I'm yet to read your response to them, and it's not found in your essays. --[[AV]]

::::Magnus, I'm going to hold out against subpages on the new wiki. I regard their existence as a bug that must be stamped out. When a subject is well-conceived, one can give an article on the subject a perfectly precise title. It's just ''unnecessary'' and ''confusing'' to put meaningless punctuation in the title, and put the article in a completely ambiguous but vaguely child-to-parent relation to another article. As an anonymous writer above said, subpages ''are'' quite often a form of laziness--it's totally true. Very often, it's a substitute for failing to think through exactly what one's subject ''is.'' --[[LMS]]

:::::Frankly, I believe that your problem with subpages is psychological and is not subject to rational argument. There are very many reasons for subpages already presented on this page none of which you acknowledged or replied to. Paper encyclopaedias employ subpages: they're called sections. Since Wikipaedia by its nature isn't as constrained by space as e.g. Britannica, its &quot;sections&quot; ''should'' for clarity and convenience be split into subpages, and the ability to link to specific subpages which then arises is definitely a good thing. Note that in the web version of Britannica sections '''are''' in fact split into several webpages and not laid out on one single huge page. By enforcing flat structure we would be losing functionality compared with paper encyclopaedias, while we really should be gaining functionality, rather than losing it. But hey, this is just '''another''' argument for subpages among a dozen or so of them on this page that you haven't addressed. It's becoming frustrating, Larry, to see you rant against subpages time and again on various talk pages or here, and then fail to respond to any counter-reasons with anything specific other than a pointer to your essays, which, with all due respect to them, contain precious little argument against subpages which aren't based on a misunderstanding about their nature (viz. that they're exactly like other pages in all respects save the parent-child relationship). --[[AV]]

::::I'm very busy, Anatoly, I have little time for people who do not respect me enough to consider my arguments, particularly when I find their own reasons to be pretty transparently wrong, and particularly when they are themselves rather new to Wikipedia and, as has happened before, simply don't understand the issues (though they think they do). I have told you where to find ''my'' arguments, which you have not shown you understand. If you want to argue against my arguments, do so there.

::::I'll tell you what. You write one long essay in which all of your substantive arguments are listed point-by-point. I will show in every case why they're wrong or why they do not, singly or together, support your view. That's the best I can do for you. --LMS
----
Why does AV have to write a long essay? It's pretty simple.

The subpages were immensely useful in constructing [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]. As others have pointed out, they add two convenient functionalities:
# creating a special link to the &quot;parent&quot; page which is a '''good''' thing
# The ability to say &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Timeline]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack/Timeline]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

That second functionality may not seem like much, but you try typing all that in over and over again.

LMS, you have not said how we benefit from the loss of the above functionality. And I hope you didn't mean to say things like &quot;I have little time for people who do not respect me enough to consider my arguments, particularly when I find their own reasons to be pretty transparently wrong, and particularly when they are themselves rather new to Wikipedia and, as has happened before, simply don't understand the issues (though they think they do)&quot; which is pretty awful, since you can get away with being rude since you're in charge, but noone else can. So I admire your policy of discouraging rudeness for everyone, including yourself: the King is not above the Law.

And you may be able to claim that AV doesn't respect you, that his reasons are transparently wrong, and that he's rather new, and simply doesn't understand the issues, but I hope you won't try claiming that about me. But you shouldn't have claimed that about anyone, because it's nonproductive, even if it's honestly felt. I don't think AV is trying to diss you. I know I'm not.

You're right that subpages are often a form of laziness; but they're not always. And you're forgetting that laziness is one of the three virtues of the programmer.

If what's really happening is that you're getting aggravated because the new system will have namespace-construction capabilities that encompass the nature of subpages but are better, then you should make that clearer. Because it's not obvious. Right now your statements have seemed a bit autocratic (&quot;I regard their existence as a bug that must be stamped out.&quot; is a bit creepy, e.g.)

I'm not losing any sleep over it. But I want to be able to want to stay with Wikipedia.
--TheCunctator
----
After resisting to move this page to [[wikipedia commentary on getting rid of subpages entirely because they are plain evil]];), I looked at [[Larry Sanger/Why I am suspicious of subpages]], which states that subpages are sometimes useful and sometimes not. I continued through the essays and ended at [[Larry Sanger/The case against subpages]], which looks more like a declaration of war to me;)

Actually, the current subpage system reminds me a lot of object-orientated languages like C++, which have a main object (like [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]) and variables and methods (like [[/Timeline]]). My point is, object-orientated languages were developed because they have major advantages compares to the &quot;flat&quot; languages, like the original C. The idea is that contents that belongs together is grouped together. I know that is not directly compareable, but the idea is the same.

AFAIK, Larry's current view is &quot;keep the / but remove the subpage functionality&quot;. But, then we'd have to limit the number of / s so there won't be things like pages/that/have/many/subpages. So, all chars are allowed, but (apart from : for namespaces) only / is restricted? Without having an actual effect? It comes to my mind that this is, to quote one of Larry's favourite words for subpages, arbitrary...

Actually, I am uncertain if I should support subpages (my script currently does), or if I should get rid of them. For the others, remember that with the new script there will (sooner or later) be a &quot;delete&quot; function for pages, maybe a &quot;rename&quot; function as well. So, Larry, you could move subpages where you don't like them, but keep them on, say, [[Poker]], where you actually seem to support them.

Just a thought : How about a user option that disables subpages? You won't see all the subspace stuff if the option is &quot;no subspaces&quot;, but others would. Sounds strange, doesn't it? --[[Magnus Manske]]
----
Larry, if you can't even be bothered to reply to arguments put on a page which you specifically created for debate about subpages, that speaks volumes about your attitude to the whole issue. It's not just my arguments on this page that you've been ignoring.

Your charge that I didn't consider your arguments and that I should reply to them on your essays' pages or write yet another essay on the subject is ridiculous both because I have already addressed them more than once and because '''this very page''' was created by you specifically for debating on subpages, which debating you then went on to ignore.

As for the 'rather new' canard, I've been playing with and watching Wikipedia for three months now (not as much as many here, of course, but not as little either), and have edited many articles with and without subpages from many diverse areas. If you made up your mind and aren't willing to entertain any arguments (which certainly seems to be the case) I suggest that you be honest about it.

I've had it for now with your condescension. So far you've shown that rational debate with you on the issue of subpages is impossible. Whatever your psychological problems are, I hope you solve them.
--[[AV]]
:Anatoly, as long as ''you'' continue to insult me, as you have done ''several'' times, I am not going to argue with you. My adopting this stance this cannot be reasonably construed either as evidence of psychological problems :-) or as a concession that your arguments are beyond answering. (For all I know, upon reexamination, I will find your arguments to be very strong indeed.) My stance should be construed as evidence that I regard your argumentative style as personally repugnant, and that in my opinion I am not personally obligated to answer all arguments from all comers. If you apologize and we start all over, I'll consider reply further to you personally. Maybe simply time will heal the wounds.

::In our first exchange on the subject, in [[Plato/Talk]], I tried to list several good reasons in favour of subpages; you answered by directing me to your essays (which I had already read by then), and generally pooh-poohing me away, suggesting ''twice'' that I'm new here and probably don't understand anything, the second time with &quot;Keep working on the project for a few months and ''then'' see how you feel about subpages&quot; (in fact, by then I had already been working on Wikipedia for a few months, as much as spare time allowed). I didn't write anything insulting on that page, and the only time (&quot;several times&quot; strains credulity and evidence) I did was on this page, after you happily ignored all the replies in the debate started by yourself, including a long list of reasons I provided in addition to those I had already listed on [[Plato/Talk]], and including plenty of points made by others, and proceeded to rudely state &quot;I'm going to hold out against subpages on the new wiki. I regard their existence as a bug that must be stamped out.&quot; (you will note, by examining this page, that I wasn't the only one who found this comment to be rather impolite).

::I therefore suggest that you critically examine your own argumentative style before you call mine &quot;repugnant&quot;.

::I will, as I said before, avoid any direct dialogue with you on the subject of subpages; therefore please feel free to continue ignoring all my arguments in favor of them.

::[[AV]]

:::Anatoly, I think this has been a series of misunderstandings from the beginning. I will write you privately; let's handle any further personal difficulties in e-mail. My e-mail address is lsanger@nupedia.com --[[LMS]]

:In the meantime, ''when I get a chance'' (it's the weekend!), I will consider the arguments per se that others have produced. --[[LMS]]
----
When I first created the subpage feature I intended to eventually add several features specific to subpages. For example, one would be able to &quot;fold&quot; subpages on [[Recent Changes]] which would display something like &quot;Popular Page &lt;i&gt;(17 subpage changes)&lt;/i&gt;&quot; rather than listing all pages. Another possibility would be automatically listing all subpages on each parent page. Unfortunately I've had limited time for working on wiki code recently so these features have not been implemented. If subpages are kept, however, they could be implemented later.

A few subpage features are still useful, like the automatic links to the parent topics, the ability to rename all subpages by renaming the parent, and the ease of creating local links.

My main concern with getting rid of subpages is that different people will come up with different standards for sectioning large pages. For example, the country pages would be less usable if some pages were &quot;Government of Algeria&quot;, others were &quot;Cuba -- Government&quot;, or even &quot;Canadian Government&quot;. Having a standard like &quot;[[Canada/Government]]&quot; makes it easier to agree on a single format. Another concern is that eliminating subpages may lead to larger pages, which may not be editable on many common browsers (Netscape browsers on Microsoft systems tend to have a 32K limit for editing pages).

I don't have strong feelings either way on this issue. Namespaces could replace the &quot;Talk&quot; pages quite nicely, and renaming/deletion may help enforce naming conventions. I'm sure Wikipedia will continue to surprise me in the future. --CliffordAdams
----
This discussion gets both too long and too emotional. Maybe we should collect the facts (and only the facts) about this at [[wikipedia subpages pros and cons]] -- [[Magnus Manske]]

I totally agree, Magnus. I'll have a look at that and try to render it into a fair presentation of the dialectic. --LMS
----
----
I think we've discussed subpages quite a bit--certainly enough to air the issues and give people a chance to state their views and change their minds--and in view of this, I've decided to get rid of them.

Let me explain this decision--I'm done arguing for it, but of course you are owed an explanation, since the issue has been very controversial.

Examining the various pages on which people have discussed them, it seems there is at least a majority of people in favor of getting rid of them or who are amenable to the idea of getting rid of them. I think it's pretty important, although perhaps not absolutely essential in every case, that we at least not contradict majority opinion, when a consensus cannot be arrived at. The majority includes many old hands who have had more experience with the problems associated with subpages than some of their newer advocates, which I also think is important. Finally, and probably as importantly as anything else, my well considered opinion is that the arguments in favor of getting rid of them are much, much stronger than the arguments in favor of keeping them. I predict yer gonna thank me in a year. (Maybe not ''all'' of you. :-) ) --[[Larry Sanger]]

-----

I've been off Wikipedia for a while and happened to check back and find this. My well considered opinion is that this is a bad mistake (and I've written about that in other places before). I probably won't be checking back to this page regularly, but do comment on [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Pinkunicorn Pinkunicorn] if you like. If subpages are removed retroactively, it'll definitely contribute to keeping me off Wikipedia.

Jumping into this discussion recklessly - i'm new to Wikipedia, just did an extensive rewrite of the Neil Gaiman section. I created the entries for each of the books in his Sandman series, which someone had linked but not created. Now, the question - one of these collections is called Brief Lives. I was a little unhappy creating this as just a new page, &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, not a subpage of anything, because if anyone ever wants to write something about Aubrey's &quot;Brief Lives&quot; (a seminal piece of biography, for anyone who doesn't know) there's going to be a rather large collision. What's the accepted way of dealing with situations like this? Should I move all the entries to be a subpage of the Sandman entry? What do those who don't like subpages suggest I do? In other words...help :) -AW (user AdamWill)

: This is a problem many others have faced in the past, and a few 
different solutions seem to have arisen.  In some cases, people
put a parenthetical clarification, such as &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Macbeth (play)&quot;.  That approach seems suitable when a huge amount can
be written about both topics.  Another method that appears to be 
used is to inline all the variants within the same page, segregated
by horizontal lines; this seems to work best when all of the topics
are brief.  You might want to browse through the Literature area and
see if there are some conventions for books.

==Comments to this discussion==
''Into the fray...'''

My name is Jan, and I'm a subpage addict. My last subpage edit was about six hours ago.

I know this particular argument is likely to be met with derision, but I use subpages on my own wiki to build &quot;nested documents&quot;, much as you would use &quot;includes&quot; in a C/C++ program.

This is really great when the subpages have general names, specific to that document. For example, in our [[EcoReality:Coop_rules|coop incorporation,]] we have it split by sections, such as &quot;Membership&quot; or &quot;Voting&quot;, but you would not want to have pages of those names in general context, because they are specific to that document, and have specific semantics within that document. In this case, the subpage is both namespace and encapsulation.

This also allows the subpages to be edited much more easily, with less chance of edit collision. Our incorporation is necessarily long, and necessarily has numerous people working on it. The time saved from not having to open the full document, scroll down to your section, make sure you didn't inadvertently change something you weren't supposed to, then sort out the merging of save collisions -- that all seems to argue for subpages for me.

If this functionality can be preserved with some other mechanism, no problem. But please don't throw the baby out with the bath water! --[[User:Bytesmiths|Bytesmiths]] 18:08, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

:Just to comment on above - subpages functionality is kept in a way. You can simply edit a section (separeted by &lt;nowiki&gt;==header==, ===subheader===, ...&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or include subpages in the content (&lt;nowiki&gt;{{/subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

The following people have left the project. The purpose of this page is to try to understand what can make people (especially good wikipedians) leave and what we can do to prevent it. If you decide to leave and wish to explain why, you could do that here.

For an up-to-date list of people who have left the English Wikipedia, see [[en:Wikipedia:Missing Wikipedians]]. 

 
* [[en:User:PMelvilleAustin|PMA]]. &quot;Grew tired of the sh*t thrown at me by POV pushers and vandals so i resigned as an Admin and [[en:Cricket (sport)|declared my innings closed]]&quot;.

* [[en:User:Optim|Optim]]: [[en:Wikipedia:Administrators|Administrator]] and [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrat]]. Missed since 19:00 PM (UTC), [[en:March 6|March 6]], [[en:2004|2004]]. Optim came to Wikipedia in [[en:2003|2003]] because he wanted to help with the creation of free educational material. He started 115 new articles and contributed more than 19 photos he took using his digital camera. He decided to leave because he felt fed up with some particular Wikipedians. He wishes to everyone Good Luck and PEACE PROFOUND. [[User:Optim|Optim]] 19:15, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)

* [[en:User:Kat|Kat]].  Gone, see regular wiki page for reasons.

* [[en:User:J Hofmann Kemp|JHK]] still lurking around, but only because she'd really like to discuss some of the issues that make her want to permanently &lt;nowiki&gt;leave/boycott&lt;/nowiki&gt; the 'pedia in favor of Nu.  See regular wiki page. Generally worn down by several trolls, but idealistic enough to hope that the 'pedia will win, eventually.  Happy that some of you have been especially encouraging (although this is the basic cause for aforementioned lurking...)

* [[User:Manning Bartlett|Manning Bartlett]] (returned...)
:I have seriously contemplated a permanent departure (and to a degree still am), but many people encouraged me not too, and so I have put my dignity aside for the moment. Interestingly, the issue over which I left has still not been resolved, much to my great disappointment. As for my reasons, I can handle a dispute with a fellow Wikipedian, but this confrontation was with a Bomis employee, from whom I personally feel we should expect a higher standard of conduct. (''Disclaimer - I get on very well with and have the highest respect for both [[user:The Cunctator|Cunctator]] and [[LMS]]. My previous comment should not be construed as taking sides in the present Cunctator-LMS dispute.'') BTW - To the antagonist in the dispute over which I nearly left - email me any time you like, I'd still like to sort this out. - [[MMGB]]

* [[en:User:Piotr Wozniak|User:Piotr Wozniak]] left with no bad feelings, see his homepage for his detailed explanation.

* [[en:User:Corvus13|User:Corvus13]] &quot;Fine. I give up. Delete everything I've ever written. There appears to be some personal thing here where if you're not part of the clique, you're not welcome. Goodbye. &quot;

* A user chose to disassociate himself from the Wikipedia without offering any explanation except to reassure people.  Despite this another user continually tried to list him on this page.

* [[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]] Sharply curtailed editing, and will soon cease all together, due to treatment by LMS and the institution of what The Cunctator perceives as autocratic policies on Wikipedia.

* [[User:LA2|LA2]] left the Wikipedia project on May 21, 2001 after a disagreement with LMS on whether Wikipedia is a dictionary or not, and whether the distinction between an encyclopedia and a dictionary is even a useful one. He then did nothing for a long while, and finally on October 1, 2001 opened his own shop (in Swedish) at http://susning.nu/ using a slightly different policy. He is now back in the English and German Wikipedias, and the mailing lists, and is glad that he has a Wiki life outside of Wikipedia, so he doesn't have to fight battles for his opinions anymore. This removes a lot of pressure, which he can use for expanding his own site.

* [[en:User:Graham Chapman|User:Graham Chapman]] On [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_utilities/Page_titles_to_be_deleted&amp;oldid=44512 page titles to be deleted]: &quot;OK, I'm out of here, too many fuckwits and their egos to be bothered with&quot;

You know, People??  I still believe wikipedia is not your &quot;free-for-life&quot; encyclopedia. I know Jimmy Wales got a &quot;brain hemorrhage&quot; when I said something like that a few months ago. What's the point of wikipedia, if not to sell ads or get financial reward, even if hidden from the writers ? Nobody is going to convince me otherwise. There's a hidden agenda at work here. Wiki is not a tax deduction for Bomis, and all of us who DON'T earn a cent spending hundreds of hours a month, will eventually see this is true. That is WHY Larry needs good people around to play his little Tom Sawyer mind game, and let all paint the fence. After the paint dries, it's only history. You will not even get credit, because, as Larry said so often, &quot;It's not your article, it belongs to wikipedia.&quot; There's no disclosure on Bomis' part about employees, salaries, or even why a free encyclopedia would be supported by any corporation. An educational institution might do this. So, &lt;i&gt;&quot;The game is a lot bigger than I think you know, and if you think you know then I don't think you know.&quot; (DMX) &lt;/i&gt; If we're all in it for ego's sake, then &quot;swell-up&quot; heads.  You'll be having a nightmare when the whip comes down, and it will ! [[en:User:BF|User:BF]]

:For BF's benefit: I'm not aware of having a hidden agenda at work here.  I want to build a giant encyclopedia.  Also, as everybody knows, I am paid to do this.  We have never made it a secret that, ''eventually,'' we will start making money with this website, at the very least to pay for my salary and other costs.  (It's in the FAQ!)  Eventually, I hope very much, Wikipedia ''will'' be able to pay for my salary and those of more people!  But right now, Jimbo is taking a loss--quite a substantial loss, in fact, which makes me worried for my job.  So, I fully and completely admit that part of my reason for wanting Wikipedia to grow is so that I can support myself and my family.  Unless it does grow, I will be out of a job.  So, understandably I hope, you can see that I make it a high priority that it continues to grow!  But I hope it's obvious that I totally believe in this cause, and that I don't want it to grow ''just'' because I want to keep my job! --[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

While this is a little bit off-topic here, some food for thought: All content is FDL and can be downloaded for free. I have done so, and probably others have as well. What is the worst that can happen? We might lose a server, but we will never lose the data. And the bandwidth requirements for a trimmed down version of Wikipedia (account-only), should the need ever arise, may be more modest than you think. -- [[w:Eloquence]]

: The worst that could happen is a post-failure fork. The only properties that Bomis owns that are relevant are the wikipedia.com domain and its associated ''mindshare'' and ''bandwidth.'' In the event that Bomis fails, then Wikipedia may never recover its momentum. Thus, it's in everyone's interest to see Bomis not fail and for Bomis to not encourage forking. -- SunirShah

:: I agree that a fork would be a bad thing, but as long as old-hands can be informed, I don't think that its consquences would be drastic, since their participation alone would guarantee a quick re-build. -- Eloq.

We'll certainly do all we can to avoid giving anyone reason to fork! --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
While forking could be detrimental, reuse could be very beneficial. In short, while in some sense it's trying to cover &quot;all human knowledge&quot;, Wikipedia has a particular style and scope, (which it should, though I might disagree with some of the particular choices made). 

Ideally, at some point, there will be enough cross-pollinating sites that instead of there being the Wikipedia data which other people use, there will be this common pool of complementary information that all can draw. For example, there could be a news service which focuses on current events, using Wikipedia for background. And the news stories would provide background for new Wikipedia entries.

A project like CPAN to mirror content in some way, delink it from a particular server or URL (the content, not the creation process) might be a step in that direction. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia sentences are of 3 kinds:
*true sentences
*context dependent sentences
*some untrue and ambiguous sentences that eventually are going to be removed. 

If true sentences could be extracted from wikipedia, they could be used to create a knowledge database and a virtual mind with the ability to answer to questions.

'''links:'''
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindpixel MindPixel]: digital mind modeling project http://www.mindpixel.com
----
Sounds groovy.  I can't wait. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

How do you establish truth?--[[user:Seb]]
*We should establish truth by creating a wiki-[http://www.strategiccomm.com/logictree.html Logic-Tree] where branches are analyzed based on their validity. If an argument is found to be guilty of a logical [http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ Fallacy] then it's branch will be labeled as such.  

Perhaps you don't have to.  You could create an irrational, fallible AI.  Surely that would do better on Turing tests?
*Surely in the process of scanning the data, any inconsistencies would emerge. This could then be used as a source of directions as to places where Wikipedia needs to be checked. [[User:PhilBoswell|Phil]] 17:12, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)
--------
Perhaps a feature coud be added to pages presented to browsers that would allow a highlight of a sentence and a vote by non anonymous browsers stating true, false, maybe, a nubmer or weight on scale, etc.  The sentence and vote could be forwarded to a virtualmind server for processing or recorded and forwarded in batch or maintained as part of wikipedia.  It seems out of focus to me, first we get a successful free encyclopdia.

If this  was set up as a separate project we agree to forwad data to then it would have the advantage of easily incorporating data from other sources as well.

Interesting concept but not essential to getting the wikipedia up and running usefully and reliably .... unless we need to interest more highly creatve, capable software people in programming and debugging?  [[user:mirwin]]
--------

Sounds to me like this proposal is specifically a proposal for an alternative[[interface]].  The idea is that the people are the minds.  But this interface could also use an emergent interconnectivity scheme like [[www.amazon.com]] uses, or perhaps similiar ideas like that, where the user's activities implicity create pathways.   In summary: advanced interface, emergent organization, and advanced search methods. = the virtual mind. [[user:Kevin_baas]] -2003.03.14
--------

Regarding the 3 kinds of sentences in the original post on this page, I would argue that all sentences, knowledge, facts, words, meanings and truths are contextual. Besides, there is no way for a system without senses to verify truth about the world, which presumably is what is meant by truth here (as opposed to truths only about Internet content). Voting may be a decent heuristic for validation, but I think it would be thoroughly worthwhile to &quot;simply&quot; parse and classify all statements made on a site such as the Wikipedia, and be able to perform queries on it. If contradictory statements are made on the same or similar subjects, perhaps the system can flag it, or the querying party can decide what to believe.

I would be interested to hear if anyone has made any prototypes in this sort of direction.

There are known knowns. 
There are things we know we know. 
We also know 
There are known unknowns. 
That is to say 
We know there are some things 
We do not know. 
But there are also unknown unknowns,

This is an area I've always been very interested in (I'm studying AI at university, indeed). A couple of quick thoughts that occur are:
*[http://openmind.org OpenMind] is a collaborative effort similar to MidPxel but somewhat more structured.
*[[en:everything2|everything2]]'s &quot;soft links&quot; implement a similar kind of quasi-semantic linkage suggested by Kevin above.
*This needn't even impact Wikipedia itself - the content is redistributable after all, so the project could simply feed off dumps of the database, and have its own dedicated band of contributors.

Why not integrate the cyc knowledge server from www.opencyc.org, after all, it is open source software. But because it is under the LGPL, I'm not sure if it would be ok to integrate into this project. Cyc is a knowledge base of common sense knowledge and it can generalize from information in its knowledge base. So if you say something it can interpret it as being true or inaccurate. To read more about cyc go to www.cyc.com and www.opencyc.org 

Also e-Cyc portal toolkit, but am not not sure if it is open source. e-Cyc was used by lycos and hotbot (in hotbot beta) to help in semantics, that is in deciphering the ambiguity of the meanings of words. An example of e-Cyc in lycos would be, for example, searching for the term vets, it has two meanings, veterans and veterinarians. So, e-Cyc would help by asking you which you meant, and then filter out all the web pages with that meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical}}
In the world of the biological sciences (english-speaking and not), the standard for referring to a species is the Linnean species name, a phrase in Latin containing both a generic and specific part. This name can be equated with many differing local names. For example, ''Cervus elaphus'' is the red deer (in Europe) or elk in North America. ''Alces alces'' is moose in America, but elk in Europe.

In Wikipedia, we currently have Linnean entries redirecting to 'English' names - the equivalent of ''Cervus elpaphus'' redirecting to 'red deer'. I would like to suggest that this is horribly wrong as it ignores the primary place of the latin specific name in taxonomy. Throughout the English-speaking world, differing common names are given to a given species, yet there is only one single Linnean name, and it is the latter under which a species should be classified.

Should WikiPedia be shifted to the new PhP software, would it be possible to have a program to automatically sift through the redirects, fixing this?

Secondly, I suggest we addopt some generally accepted taxonomic standard for the naming of biological groups. The ''Tree of Life'' project (http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html) would be a good place to start for the broad classifications, while individual works (such as the ''Smithsonian Mammal Species of the World'' at http://www.nmnh.si.edu/msw/) would give acceptable guidance for individual groups.

John, this makes a lot of sense to me.  But I do think that whenever we create a page with a Linnean species name, we should ''always'' also create the English name or names for that species, include a short stub on that page that it is the English name for (Linnean name), and let people click through to the Linnean name entry.  In other words, it's just going to be very confusing for some people to click on [[moose]], only to be redirected to [[Alces alces]].  They thought they clicked on moose, but now it says they've been redirected to Alces alces.  Is this a joke?  They have to read the article itself to understand why.

So, with that caveat, I totally support your proposal. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----
Larry:

Oh, it was implicit im my proposal that multiple English names stubs would lead to the Linnean entry(e.g. moose and elk -&gt; Alces_alces &amp;amp; C. elaphus). 

Do you agree with setting up taxonomic standards which then can be used as frameworks for entries. If you get a chance, browse the &quot;Tree of Life&quot; project. [[user:John Lynch|John Lynch]]
----
OK!

Your proposal should be on some semi-official Wikipedia policy page, saying you and I (at least!) agree with it and that so far (??) nobody has disagreed. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

:Let me know where you think would be appropriate and I'll write it up. [[user:John Lynch|John Lynch]]

----
To avoid the extra click, why not put the common english name(s) just at the beginning of the article? --[[user:Seb|Seb]] (''wondering about less tiresome ways of signing...'')

:In some cases this will work.
----
&gt;Throughout the English-speaking world, differing common names are given &lt;br&gt;
&gt;to a given species, yet there is only on [sic] single Linnean name

ideally, yes, but in fact there are plenty of disputes between &quot;splitters&quot; and &quot;lumpers&quot;. e.g. most sources give ''Thalarktos maritimus'' for the [[polar bear]], but a few classify it under ''Ursus''. 

But I support this proposal. Where there are inconsistencies, we'll find ways around them - [[clasqm]]

Those discussions, although I dont understand everything, sounds interesting. Why I found this place was because I was wondering if it would be wise to put the scientific names (eg. Latin, though I think sometimes also greek?) on the latin wikipedia? Meanwhile, you might find how I have been trying to solve the tree for organisms at the Swedish wikiepedia, the basic is named [http://sv.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Systema_Naturae] and example can be seen at the polar bear, [http://sv.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Isbj%F6rn] As you see there, a horizontal concept is used, admitting the visitor to freely move within the systematic tree up and down, and stille have this &quot;framework within reach. There is a risk of some pages becoming cluttered, since a coommon name also has other meanings. This has been solved however, and the cases are so few so its not actually a big problem, compred with &quot;problem to find a good &quot;system&quot; keeping millions of organisms ready at the fingertip so you dont have to search for them.

The ''application'' of this system, used in alla plants and animals, interlinks through the word &quot;systematik&quot; with the ''explanation'' of the system, as well as a link to Linn. Those three komponents as parts of the framebar, follow every single animal plant and organism in the Swedish wikipedia, giving people possibility to instantly move to close ''or distant'' relatives at their choice.


As for the nuclear point for this discussion I can tell I made ''refering explaining pages'' from the latin names to the common, but figure the common name in each language is what &quot;people&quot; serch for. 

The case of taxonomic conflicts about what n animal shoud be called is no hinderance for a system. Its easy to inform about this, altough until internationally decided on meetings of nomenclature, each animals has only one name, although someone might want to change it, and has a ready suggestion.

I belive the Danes will evetually adopt this method, (see [[http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_naturae]]) so if you have on the meta level better ideas, I would be happy to know, before this work takes to much time and we do it in vaste.[[User:Dan Koehl|Dan Koehl]]

And an extra question: instead of every language wikipedia has a page with text:

''Canis lupus'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[[latin]] for [[language name for wolf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Would it may sence that all latin words like ''canis lupus'' was kept in the latin wikipedia, and with language top links back to the different language words for wolf. [[User:Dan Koehl|Dan Koehl]]

Quick note about the previous thread (ending with clasqm's post): The thread before this one is well over a year old. The English Wikipedia flirted with the idea of using the Linnean Latin/Greek naming system for organism names but found that that convention to be cumbersome for plants and animals that have well-known common names. It is also counter to core en.wiki naming conventions about using what most English speakers use and is not in the spirit of ''ad captandum vulgus''.  

If the average reader of an article can't recognize or can't pronounce the title of the article because we used a binomial name instead of a common name for an otherwise well-known organism, then we have failed in our mission to inform because that person will likely leave without reading the article (technical title = technical article). So it is best to keep it simple and consistant with the rest of en.wiki.  

Any other language wiki is free to choose the Linnean system for naming all organisms (although I would argue that that isn't very useful to your readers...) but the en.wiki will, for the forseeable future, continue use to the most common common names used in English with the Linnean form on the first line (and also redirected to the article). But Linnean names will still be the dominant forms eventually since the majority of named organisms don't have common names at all.  

And the idea that the Linnean names are consistant is incorrect  since biologists are changing their minds all the time. This is especially true for anything above the genus level at all times (since there are the competing 2-kingdom, 3-kingdom, 4-kingdom, 5-kingdom, 6-kingdom, 8-kingdome and 3-domain systems). This situation is really bad with fish species and genera and almost as bad for many plant groups. Oh and hybrid plant names are a taxonomic nightmare.  

Common names can and should be disambiguated and regional differences explained since this is what readers will be looking for (also searching for: External search engines will rank our articles lower if the common names are not the titles of pages). But if and when there are two roughly equally used common names for an organism then we could then use the Linnean name. Above all else; ''Regnat populus'' --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] (who is both a biologist and has taken a couple years of Latin)

:Hi Maveric, and thanks for your time. Instead of trying to explain what I meant once more I ask you please read once more what I actually wrote, please follow the links, (which in no cases goes to latin names) so we can go on using a platform where both knows what the other is speaking about. Appreciating your time. :) [[User: Dan Koehl|Dan Koehl]]

::Sorry, I thought that I was clear in stating that my words were directed at the year-old talk and not your comments. I haven't had time to respond to your comments yet. But I will find time soon. --mav

I am still thinking about the linking of latin species names to the latin language, like in the swedish wiki, the word for wolf - varg - could have a language link &lt;nowiki&gt;[[la:Canis lupus]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the latin, and from the latin back again to the different common names in different langauges, when and if apropriate. [[User:Dan Koehl|Dan Koehl]] 13:34 Jan 27, 2003 (UTC)

:Seems a good idea to have one reference page for all languages, and even for local variants of names in one languages. But I doubt that la.wikipedia.org is the right place for this. How about standards.wikipedia.org where all items can be listed by a standard and then every language has to look to insert one or more entries. URI could be standard(s).wikipedia.org/Linne/Canis_lupus or for countries standard(s).wikipedia.org/iso_3166-1/se , or for languages standard(s).wikipedia.org/iso_639-1/sv as well as standard(s).wikipedia.org/iso_639-2/sve. If no parameter is submitted like standard(s).wikipedia.org/iso_639-1 there could come a page referencing pages that describe what the standard is about.
::better idea than subdomain would be something like wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes:Linee:Canis_lupus for providing cross links to all languages [[User:Tobias Conradi|Tobias Conradi]] 14:09 8 May 2003 (UTC)

:What about central image administration for different wikipedia? The picture of the Polar bear could be used on English and Danish pages. Naming of the pics then should be after a standard. Advantage: Hard disk and bandwidth can be saved. Disadvantage: Google finds images according to their name. So maybe in the background one image but delivered under different names. We would need a big mapping database. But keep in mind: You can save a lot of work if e.g. flags for countries or animal images can be used in every wikipedia. Thus wikipedia could grow faster, people can concentrate on editing texts and if someone contributes images she will know that much more people will use and see her work. [[User:Tobias Conradi|Tobias Conradi]] 04:03 7 May 2003 (UTC)

::I understood this would be the case in a phase IV version of the software. Along with common user database, and possibility of easy links between wikipedias (currently the english wiki can be linked easily on every wiki using the &quot;w :&quot; and the meta with &quot;m :&quot; but no other wiki can do the same - this imho is also slowing down growth and crossing). I have many pict of landscape and flowers I take myself, but uploading them small size and sometimes big size on even 2 wikis is boring me to death :-) Clearly, a lot of time and energy is lost here. I would also love to see maps of the [[w:ecoregion]]s, but just the idea of having to make them, in several languages, then to upload them is unthinkable.&lt;br&gt;
I saw once (where ?) that phase IV would not be planned before at least the end of this year. I do not know if this perspective is still correct though. I think developpers have more important things to do before.

:::''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links are a historical artifact from the days when only English-Wikipedia and Meta existed, and are deprecated. If they behave differently from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[en:foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; this is purely by accident, and should not be relied upon, as it's a '''bug''' which will eventually be fixed.''

:::''A common store for images is planned, but not yet set up. The cancerous growth of GFDL-incompatible images on the English section should probably be stopped before we do that, though. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 22:05 7 May 2003 (UTC)''

This originally appeared on [[Creationism/Talk]]. I thought it deserved to be broken out onto its own page, so I did so.

'''Larry's Big Reply'''

Before I reply, let me just say that if we can agree that [[creationism]] as it stands, apart perhaps from the fact that the evolutionist insists on having the last word, is adequately unbiased, then our dispute is probably academic. So--on with the academic dispute!

I ''totally'' agree with your guys' attitude toward creationism. I think it's silly nonsense, too. Let's get that straight--we don't need to debate the merits of the theory (unless Bruce wants to do so). Moreover, I am probably the biggest commonsense realist and defender of rationality here. If you think my position is rooted in anything like relativism, that is excellent evidence that you don't understand my position and that you need to re-read what I've written more carefully. Jimbo, too, is a realist and defender of rationality, and he shares my view (in generalities, at least), as you can see on [[neutral point of view]]. Gee, how can that be? Read on.

''Why on earth would I wanna do that, Larry? It's not like I advocate Creationism as such or anything. I only tried to point out that beating on the creationists is counter-productive. - AyeSpy (aka BrucieBaby)''

1. Is evolution controversial? Yes--to the public at large, which will be reading Wikipedia. No--to scientists. For whom are we writing? The public at large--''and'' scientists. (Perhaps that's what causes our problem here.) Lee says: &quot;General articles on biology, on the other hand, should simply treat evolution as uncontroversial, because no serious biologist disagrees, and failure to do so compromises understanding of the subject.&quot; I think this is wrong on two counts. First, while evolution is uncontroversial among serious biologists, it ''is'' controversial among an alarmingly large portion of the general public; you do them and yourselves no favors by ignoring this controversy. Second, I see no reason to believe that recognizing that nonbiologists do not accept evolution as fact in any way &quot;undermines understanding&quot; of evolution. It doesn't even undermine your ''real'' goal, of course, which is to get people to ''accept'' evolution instead of getting caught up in idiotic creationist nonsense. In fact, the opposite is true: by failing to recognize the controversy, you essentially alienate the people you most want to teach. You would prefer indoctrination, it seems.

''I think you may overestimate the controversy over evolution in the general public, but I agree with your point wholeheatedly - AyeSpy''

2. Will we have to qualify ''every'' statement, or even ''every'' page, with a statement to the effect that it is the view of scientists? No, of course not. Why not? Because it's not controversial ''to anyone.'' Will we have to highlight discredited minority views as prominently as scientific fact? Of course not.

3. If we do describe scientific fact as what is accepted by all or nearly all scientists, then how are we misleading ''anyone''? The question, again, is ''how''? Have we ''encouraged'' anyone to believe anything other than what you want them to believe? Where's the downside you all fear?

4. Josh writes: &quot;Historical revisionists are probably more important even. Yes, they can be interesting, but statement of their opinions as anything even resembling potential fact isn't just wrong, it is potentially offensive.&quot; Josh, I am ''not'' saying that historical revisionism should be presented as &quot;anything even resembling potential fact.&quot; I am saying that the view should be described and appropriately attributed. How does that imply that the opinions will be presented as &quot;anything even resembling potential fact&quot;? Please bear in mind that we can reserve ''plenty'' of room for '''attributed''' explanations of why mainstream historians regard various kinds of historical revisionism as so much hokum. Our including such explanations is absolutely essential to having an unbiased encyclopedia, by the way.

5. Josh again: &quot;To take the extreme example, even if it invokes Godwin's law against myself, what do you suppose would be the response if we said the holocaust was something widely considered to have occured by most historians, rather than something that occured? I'd consider that an awful legitamization of some of the worst opinions available.&quot; I would say that this is a very poor illustration (i.e., a &quot;straw man&quot;) of my position. I imagine we should first clearly present what is generally believed about the Holocaust; then, perhaps quite far down in the article, we should have a paragraph or two that says something to the effect that the above is accepted (in generalities anyway) by all but a very small handful of trained historians, called Holocaust deniers and revisionists, blah blah blah, and explain the facts of that. This then ''attributes'' the claims about the Holocaust in a perfectly appropriate way and also mentions the fact that there is another (very minority) view. At the same time, we can state that most historians (most ''people'') find such revisionism not only obviously false, but extremely morally repugnant. I hope I am making my position clearer now.

6. Is my position &quot;spineless&quot;? Jmlynch thinks so: &quot;in accordance with the views of 99% of theologians, scientists and philosophers, they are wrong. We should state so emphatically. To do otherwise is to be spineless. ... This, I assure you, is contrary to the aims of any good project (particularly if it is haunted by the shades of the original Encyclopediestes).&quot; Well, as a modern-day encyclopedist who has thought for many, many hours about this stuff (even before I started working on an encyclopedia), I can &quot;assure you&quot; that our doing what I ask is ''not'' in the slightest &quot;spineless.&quot; Well, so much for mutual assurances; now to arguments. I think I can understand your reason for thinking so. Your assumption appears to be that, ''if'' we do not ''explicitly'' declare something to be true, then the reader can draw certain inferences ''about us''--such as that we wish to placate creationists, or that we think creationism might be scientifically respectable, or that we might be creationists ourselves, etc., etc. Well, no. Reasonable people do not draw such inferences when presented with unbiased texts. You yourself, Jim, would not typically draw such inferences--you know better, of course. Suppose that a history text adopted a policy of failing to identify Nazi scum as the murdering bastards they were--but simply reported the facts about what they did. Would it be reasonable to assume that the text's author(s) might just be willing to admit the possibility that the Nazis were upstanding citizens doing a service to Europe?

''Factually, I have read some very dry and &quot;non-judgemental&quot; accounts, practically devoid of adjectives. They still gave me the heebeejeebees and I never thought for a moment the author favored the Nazis. - AyeSpy''


:-- The facts about what they did, simply reported, permit most readers to judge for themselves that the Nazis were in fact &quot;murdering bastard scum&quot;. Readers who make the judgement that the Nazis were in fact &quot;upstanding citizens doing a service to Europe&quot; would probably not be influenced by the editor's stating his/her personal opinion to the contrary. Arguably, we are insulting the reader by assuming he/she needs to be &quot;pushed&quot; to see things our way. -- 27 Septenber 2001.



7. Are being fact-stating and unbiased independent goals? No: in order to be unbiased, you ''must'' be fact-stating. In particular, you must be very clear about how you word the facts about what various majority and minority positions are. I contrast (in the present context--not when I'm talking metaphysics &amp;amp; philosophy of language, where 'fact' is a technical term) fact with opinion; opinions can be correct (and thus fact-stating), but one ''identifies'' something ''as'' a fact to emphasize that it is not under dispute, and one ''identifies'' something ''as'' an opinion in order to emphasize that it ''is'' under dispute. If, in our evolution article, we say that evolution is a &quot;proven fact,&quot; while this is no doubt true (i.e., evolutionary theory has met ordinary standards of scientific evidence), the force of ''saying it'' is that evolution is simply not under dispute. Well, it ''is'' under dispute ''by your readers,'' guys. And (damnably) ''that's'' a fact. You aren't going to change their minds, or make the world otherwise any safer for rationality and science (which I love at least as much as you do), by explicitly averring that evolution is a fact and creationism is false. Actually, what you do is close off the avenues of discourse by doing so, setting up the less-rational folk in an antagonistic stance toward you, and make it harder to help them see the light. (Think of this as intellectual diplomacy.)

8. &quot;Further, one can easily propagandize by stating only facts.&quot; Very true; that's why we shouldn't refer to my position as ''merely'' that articles should be fact-stating. They should be unbiased. I've explained what I mean by this in many different places many different times. &quot;A full page of 'Creationists believe that...because...' with no reference to contradictory evidence or any other claim is clearly a propaganda piece, even though it happens to be fact-stating.&quot; I totally agree, and I will thank you for not setting up further caricatures of my view.

9. &quot;I also believe that it is fundamentally impossible to eliminate all bias, and the all readers of any purportedly-factual article should understand that all authors have biases, and read in that context.&quot; But whenever we can ''identify'' bias, we can ''eliminate'' it--one way or another, and usually by going &quot;meta.&quot; Give yourself some credit; people are creative; we can think of ways to eliminate bias when we spot it. (If you're still not convince, I suspect this is because you have a useless, impossibly-restrictive concept of bias. Personally, I prefer my concepts to be useful.)

10. &quot;I believe that being overly afraid of bias sometimes compromises those goals, by cluttering articles with reportage on clearly useless beliefs held by a few minorities.&quot; Why think that articles will be ''cluttered'' with views held by minorities? If they are minority views, they will not be ''highlighted'' and ubiquitous in the same way that the majority views will be. That's as it should be. No one can reasonably complain.

My conclusion:

'''We should not impose our values on other thinking people.''' You are all liberal-minded people, I trust--not liberal politically, necessarily, but liberal in the sense that you want to free minds. I enjoin you to think carefully about the best way to achieve this. By failing to take stands on controversial issues, we ''aren't'' demonstrating weakness--in fact, we are demonstrating the strength of our faith in the minds of our fellow human beings. We should let them arrive at their own conclusions. We should trust them to use their own minds--just as ''you'' want to be trusted. More benighted souls than our enlightened selves will appreciate our stance and be more apt to listen when we hand down the truth.

I don't know if I can make my case any more completely...

''13Nov01''. What is the value of encyclopedic knowledge? As Wikipedians move into the metapedia and Wikipedia begins to get back to the serious business of creating encyclopedia articles, my musings have returned to a topic that is of great interest to me. I ended my formal academic training seventeen years ago at the Bachelor's level. I took my school's exhortation about lifelong learning seriously, though, and I have continued to study and read informally. When the World Wide Web began spreading information at an accelerated rate not seen in the world since Gutenberg's printing press, I thought I had finally found the ultimate means to acquire knowledge. (Hypertext is the ''foundation'' of the Web's power.) Then, when I found the Wikipedia, I ''knew'' I had arrived. There is so much knowledge already stored at Wikipedia, and the content is growing so fast, that I hold out little hope of absorbing all that I even ''want'' to know! (And that's not counting what I don't ''care'' about, like rock bands. :-)

I just finished adding to the outline at the stub article, [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/History_of_Christianity History of Christianity]. Students spend years -- even ''lifetimes'' -- just attempting to master that single subject. But that article, like all others at Wikipedia, will evolve powered by ''numerous'' scholars around the world. We're privileged to count a [[User:Larry_Sanger|philosopher]], an [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/MichaelTinkler art historian], a [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/AxelBoldt mathematician], and a [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/J_Hofmann_Kemp medieval historian] (to name only the few I'm most familiar with) among the ranks of Wikipedians. What a treasure trove of knowledge!

So can I really fulfill my dream of acquiring advanced knowledge without the rigors of a graduate education?

I need to get some sleep now, so I'm leaving this undone. Please discuss.

''&lt;&gt;&lt; [[user:tbc|tbc]]''

Yes you can. But it has always been like this: a dedicated person could do it by devoting time and effort into it. The difference is that it's getting much easier and quicker now. You don't have to leave your chair; you click, you read, and you follow your curiosity. Actually this may be in some ways better than the rigors of a graduate education, because _you_, not the professors, get to choose what you will learn and in what order. Basically we're gradually eroding the educational institutions' monopoly over knowledge (but keep in mind that they still have the monopoly over official certification, and will fight tooth and nail to keep it). --[[Seb]]
----
Well, they don't have a monopoly over official certification, if by that you mean certification for a bachelor's degree by taking college courses.  Read about Regents College in New York State.  Pretty cool.

I have no answer for you, Tim, except to say that the only way a philosopher gets to have the knowledge he has is by (1) reading a bunch of books and papers about a very narrow subject, (2) writing at least several papers about that subject, and (3) talking to other philosophers about the subject.  Those are the essential tasks; it isn't necessary to be in a university to do them, but that makes it easier because you have a natural financial incentive to do them.  If, like me, you have a 40 hour a week job, you will find it rather difficult to do the reading and writing necessary to keep up your scholarly chops.  :-( --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]</text>

      <comment>fixed most old InterWiki links, moved &amp; shortened &quot;note to readers&quot;</comment>
      <sha1>f6cf0021vcukl1wg8cjqsmgyuwz8g91</sha1>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note to reader. This page was moved to meta.wikpedia.com from somewhere else (probably [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl MeatBall], the original wiki-meta-discussion-site), and while most  [[MeatBall:InterWiki|InterWiki]] links where fixed to point to something sensible again, because of differing [[MeatBall:LinkPattern|LinkPatterns]], some originally intended links might have been lost. So please feel free to do further research in these wikis:

* MeatballWiki http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl
* WikiWiki http://c2.com/cgi/wiki 
* SisterSites http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SisterSites

----

Issues: 

* Wikipedia has been delisted from [http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl MetaWiki].
* Wikipedia is currently forking FOLDOC, which I consider bad. Alternate solution is to use [http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl MetaWiki] + [[MeatBall:TwinPages]] + [[MeatBall:WikiNameCanonicalization]].

----

As for the &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; and FOLDOC, I'm afraid I don't understand. The content on [[MeatBall:TwinPages]] wasn't very clear to me, but it seems to be a scheme for synchronizing pages between wikis. If this is correct, then this would have no bearing on our use of FOLDOC content. We're not interested in mirroring FOLDOC, but using content from it to as a base to build our own articles. I would like to hear some more details though, in case I have things wrong. --[[STG]]

I'm kind of wondering why Wikipedia is no longer being indexed by [http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl MetaWiki].  I thought that was pretty cool, anyway.  Wouldn't [http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl MetaWiki] users find it useful? --[[Larry Sanger]]

----

There are more than one [[MetaWiki]]. You'll find more on [[MeatBall:MetaWiki]]. I suspect Wikipedia stopped listing because http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=index no longer functions. The best solution to this is to provide a plaintext listing of all the page titles, but I don't have time to develop this myself these days, so that's why I just dropped it. However, now that I discovered the FOLDOC thing, perhaps we should do it.

:''action=index works just fine on Wikipedia. You just have to give it a minute or so. Probably your script timed out. --[[AxelBoldt]]''

:I just tried it, and it does indeed work... if you have about ten minutes to spare. [[UseModWiki]] doesn't seem to be able to handle our 27000+ pages very well. I got to the &quot;L&quot; pages before stoping it; almost 1 meg for half the index. I'm rather disappointed that we were delisted from [[MeatBall:MetaWiki]], without any questions as to what the problem was. A quick question to [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] and a test of http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=index would have cleared up the problem. --[[STG]]

: Aye, I just delisted it two days ago. Like I said, I ''just'' came here to find out what was going on. This page may have started off about [[TheCuncator]] reversing a change I made to correct a poor usage of '[[Wiki:WikiWiki]]', and some resolution of the &quot;move chaff onto other wikis&quot; comment, but now we're on the ball. No worries. --ss

This would allow using [[MeatBall:TwinPages|TwinPages]] between [[MeatBall:WikiPedia|Wikipedia]] and FOLDOC. All that means is that whenever two pages of the same name exist on the different sites, a link is put at the bottom to the other site. This is not unlike Google placing a link to dictionary.com at the top of your query. There are several advantages to this scheme.

* No duplicated effort.
* More focused sites.
* Better scaling into non-related domains, such as atlases.
* Ability to benefit from non-GDLed sites (even though not necessarily those who don't have similar licenses)

An example of where this would have been useful is FOLDOC's incorporation of The Jargon File. As Raymond periodically updates TJF, FOLDOC periodically goes out of sync. Similarly, if Wikipedia updates an entry in FOLDOC, FOLDOC will go out of sync. Possibly also TJF.

I have to check my e-mail at home. I'll do that and get back to you on this. -- [[SunirShah]]

----

Well, Mr. Howe hasn't replied yet, which means that anything we do could only be temporary or experimental. I suggest the following incremental steps:

* Creation of a plaintext listing of page titles that can be acquired by [http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl MetaWiki] once a night. This can entire be statically created once a day or be dynamically generated. Minimally you could do a ls -1R on the wiki database.

* I'll reindex [[WikiPedia]].

* Add a &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; patch to [[UseModWiki]] that we would apply to [[WikiPedia]].

* Add a sister pages patch to [[UseModWiki]] so it behaves much like [[Wiki:WikiWiki]]. That is, pages that don't already exist in the system but exist on sister sites will form a link anyway.

-- [[SunirShah]]
-----------
I have no problem with proposals a downloadable list of page titles, or you indexing Wikipedia. However, I'm not too sure I like &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; or sister pages on Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a different culture from most wikis, and doesn't really fit in with the wider wiki community. How would &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; or sister pages help Wikipedia as an encyclopedia?

Finally, we aren't going to stick with [[UseModWiki]]. We have our own particular needs as a wiki, and we need custom software to meet those needs. (And personally I have some plans to add non-wiki features to Wikipedia software, such as a database backed yearbook or biographical listing, although whether we'll actually do it I don't know.) -- [[User:SJK|SJK]]

I'm not being clear. I don't intend the &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to be between [[WikiPedia]] and, say, [[Wiki:WikiWiki]]. The links are to be between [[WikiPedia]] and FOLDOC. It's also secondary whether Wikipedia is a wiki or not. http://advogato.org incorporates the [[MeatBall:InterWiki|InterWiki]] space through the &lt;wiki/&gt; tag.

To address your second concern, it's irrelevant whether you will be using [[UseModWiki]] later. The technology is trivial to implement, so it shouldn't be difficult to move. Since currently you are using [[UseModWiki]], it's possible to upgrade [[UseModWiki]]. We should've written a &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; patch available for [[UseModWiki]] a long time ago anyway, so it's not much loss to do this. -- [[SunirShah]]

----
Sunir,

I found this discussion via [[RecentChanges]], and I read it with great interest. I just wanted to add another voice to the crowd about Wikipedia being a &quot;different&quot; kind of wiki. We're becoming a very focused community rallying around the grand vision of a copyleft encyclopedia. What attracts me most to this project and makes me more active here than on any other wiki is the goal of becoming an authoritative source for information about the material named by the pages. I started out at Ward's wiki , but I lost interest because the community wasn't universal. I've dabbled in the [[MeatBall:MeatballWiki|MeatballWiki]], but it, too, isn't universal. There's something missing about writing ''about'' a topic until there exists a wiki page that steps up and takes on the role of making authoritative and universal statements about that topic. That's why I find Everything2 so unsatisfying that I have never even ''attempted'' to edit or create a node there. Wikipedia fills a void on the Web and in wikispace by serving as a repository for a [[neutral point of view]] treatment of ... well, of ''everything!'' (Ok, so I'm exaggerating. As [[Larry Sanger|Larry]] has pointed out, not everything is suitable for expansion into an encyclopedia article. But there certainly are ''a lot'' of pages at Wikipedia yet to be created that ''are'' suited to treatment in an encyclopedia.)

About [[UseModWiki]]. I have some regret about leaving that software behind, but I agree with the concept of a wiki designed especially for the purposes of this project. (Thanks, Magnus!)

About the confusion over the term &quot;metawiki.&quot; We talked about this on [[Wikipedia-L]].  See [http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-November/000741.html], for instance. We're calling http://meta.wikipedia.com/ the &quot;metapedia.&quot;

About &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt;. We really like [[MeatBall:FreeLink|free links]] at Wikipedia, and [[MeatBall:TwinPages]] says bumpy case is the only proposed support on the table right now. Won't that limit its effectiveness for Wikipedia pages? But assuming free links are eventually supported by &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt;, I think &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; has a chance of working its way into Wikipedia at a later stage in the project. That is, once we have established a reputation as an ''encyclopedia'' and not just a wannabe project trying to ''build'' an encyclopedia, [[tbc/Wikipedia configuration management|I've already said]] that I think we'll have to have a way to represent article content as &quot;released.&quot; I see the project moving to a dual state where it has a reputation as a reference for information ''and'' it's still under development by Wikipedians (as it ''always'' will be). In that state, I think &lt;nowiki&gt;TwinPages&lt;/nowiki&gt; makes sense as a tool for Wikipedians -- not so much for readers looking for authoritative information about a topic. I suppose ''until'' that time, it would makes sense because it might attract authors from the other wikis to contribute to the encyclopedia article.

Finally, it seems to me that the discussion here is exactly why we are trying to move content ''about'' Wikipedia to the [[MeatBall:metapedia|metapedia]]. [[Wikipedians]] want to focus on recent changes to ''encyclopedia articles.'' I think there's consensus that the metapedia will operate much more like a traditional wiki. ''&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[tbc]]''

Technical issue first: I invented [[MeatBall:WikiNameCanonicalization]] for use by [[MeatBall:MetaWiki|MetaWiki]]'s [[MeatBall:TwinPages|TwinPages]] interface. That is, arbitrary typographic changes to a link name all map to the same page with some &quot;canonicalization&quot; of that name. For example, http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl?wiki=Foldoc&amp;amp;twin=airplanerule. And before anyone complains that such and such a case is not handled, the canonicalization rules are easy to change.

I think [[UseModWiki]] does this too, or will be doing this soon, or at least ''should'' be doing this. I suggested doing so about a million times. 

I agree that this is meta and could legitimately be sloughed onto metapedia. This page kind of evolved here. If someone wants to do what's done to move this page to metapedia, go ahead. I'm not about to attempt to break yet another Wikipedia convention by acting, as I seem to be prone to doing. :)

Regarding your feeling on the timeframe of the change. The point is that currently Wikipedia is in the process of forking FOLDOC. If you think this is a bad thing (and I definitely do), you need another solution. Future considerations are side benefits. If you're interested in thinking about the future, there are ''potentially'' many benefits. But I'm not into potentiality. At some point you have to decide Wikipedia is ready. If you're going to decide in favour, it's better to do this before forking a large body of work.

I don't really believe that this will be much more than a fork. If you consider a random page, [[en:10base2|10base2]] compared to http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?10base2, they are identical. It's not really likely anyone is going to update this page. Or at least the majority of the pages. I find that worrisome, as it's a waste of resources. It's also not how the Internet (used to) works. The nice feature of the 'net is that it's distributed and networked, so the responsibility for resource doesn't have to (nor shouldn't) belong to one domain, but shared amongst many parties. -- [[SunirShah]]
----
I am not at all opposed to Sunir's solution--where FOLDOC has an article about X, and Wikipedia has an article also precisely named X, then exchange links.  This doesn't do much harm, and prevents a fork--nearly ''always'' a good thing.  Besides, it gets people who want to work on FOLDOC to work on Wikipedia!  :-)  The trouble, of course, is finding someone to do the necessary coding.  :-(

On the more general issue, bear in mind that it's our goal with Wikipedia to create a huge general encyclopedia.  Not a huge general encyclopedia, minus information about computer science (for instance).  Other websites don't share this goal or are generally incompatible with Wikipedia's format or aim (e.g., they're proprietary, or they include a lot of, indeed, &quot;cruft&quot;).  By creating a single repository of all knowledge (at some general level), as general encyclopedias aspire to be (after all!), Wikipedia surely will not render the Internet any ''less'' distributed than it is right now.

Indeed, one might take your reasoning to its logical conclusion, Sunir, and say that the WWW is already a huge distributed encyclopedia.  And so it is, no doubt, much more useful than Wikipedia is at present, and given that Wikipedia is part of the WWW and that the WWW will always be much larger than Wikipedia (and that size implies usefulness--hmmm), the web will always be more useful than Wikipedia.  But look at it like this--part of what makes Wikipedia so ''cool'' is that all this attention and energy is focused on creating a neutral, encyclopedic resource about ''everything,'' and everyone working on every part of it has (or should have) more or less the same goal, roughly (!) the same standards, and similar understanding of the most general Wikipedia policies.  It's difficult to make ''that'' distributed.  Alternatively, one could consider the efforts of the 100+ people per day who work on Wikipedia to be a greatly distributed effort!

(Actually, maybe this page should live on its own discussion page here on the &quot;metapedia.&quot;  Maybe we shouldn't use the name &quot;metapedia,&quot; by the way: it's registered.  http://www.metapedia.com ) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----

Hmm, I don't think the move to meta.wikipedia.com was a good idea. The syntax processing isn't working correctly, and everytime I load a page, my browser gives me an error. That will make this discussion more painful than it needs to be. I think I might move the page back unless there are any objections. (Magnus: steal code, save headaches. See http://tavi.sourceforge.net especially, and also http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net )

Anyway, coding isn't much of a problem. Support within meta.wikipedia.com isn't necessary at the moment. I could help with the [[UseModWiki]] script. I might also finally implement [[MeatBall:PageDeletion]] too, which from the mailing list you apparently need.

On the more general issue, I'm not going to venture much. There are a lot of potential general arguments, but all ignore specific details that are salient. Specifically, at this time, you are faced with forking FOLDOC, specifically. Whether or not FOLDOC's existence is a threat to the very worth of Wikipedia I'll leave to philosophers. I'm not even capable of judging if Wikipedia is &quot;worth&quot; doing, as I never use encyclopaedia.

Nonetheless I will offer two things. Consider the extrapolation of your line of thinking. You are walking down the road where the only logical course of action is to accumulate all knowledge in your repository to the exclusion of others. I wouldn't support a project like that. It's not ethical, and it's hypocritical with the very goals of the GNU FDL. 

Only in the Roman times has the worth of an encyclopaedia been to accumulate all knowledge, and I'd argue that was more harmful than beneficial. In modern times, an encyclopaedia is merely a synopsis of existing knowledge. It doesn't create new knowledge. An encyclopaedia exists to collate and organize information so a casual student may learn the basics of a topic, and an intermediate student may learn enough of a topic to search deeper through the literature of the given field.

If Wikipedia really wanted to be an Internet encyclopaedia &quot;by the people&quot;, I think it would benefit from recognizing that context and taking advantage of the realities of the Internet. Wikipedia could serve as an organization of the information on the Internet as well, organizing other Internet resources (through URIs) within its structure. That would be really useful role given the &quot;lost in a snowstorm&quot; feeling many have.

But that's projection and futurism, not something I do. Right now, I think the chief benefit that Wikipedia has it that the participants have fun doing it. We could end up discussing whether or not it really meets the ideals of an encyclopaedia, and I'd point out that no encyclopaedia ever will be neutral or complete, but that's a scary postmodernism argument trying to burst out. Let's cap that oil fire right now, shall we? ;) -- [[SunirShah]]
----
It seems you're missing some context about the software change, why we're doing it, and why this wiki exists here at meta.wikipedia.com.  Please don't make it sound as if we had not given it a lot of thought; we certainly have.  You make a perfectly valid point, though, viz., that we could borrow code from other sources.  For all I know, we already have done so.

:You are walking down the road where the only logical course of action is to accumulate all knowledge in your repository to the exclusion of others. I wouldn't support a project like that. 

Neither would I!  :-)  But I don't see why having all knowledge in one repository--which is not exactly Wikipedia's goal, but no matter--''would'' be to the exclusion of others.  That it ''wouldn't'' be was precisely my point of my last contribution to this page!  Wikipedia certainly is not an attempt to become ''the only'' free encyclopedia, but to become a ''comprehensive'' encyclopedia.  Our being comprehensive does not entail our (absurdly) attempting to become ''the only'' free encyclopedia.

The rest is very interesting, but I don't have time to do it justice.  :-)

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I agree with pretty much everything you say, Sunir, but the leadership has decided to avoid accountability and consensus, which leads inevitably to behavior which is autocratic and antithetical to the GFDL. This is one person for whom Wikipedia has ceased being enjoyable. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

I don't feel like getting into this again, but for Sunir's benefit, I want to point out that most Wikipedians do not share the opinion expressed here regarding Wikipedia's leadership. --STG

----

There now exists a second use case. [[PlanetMath]]. See http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-November/000791.html

So... what's the story, folks? Are we going to lose our momentum here? -- [[SunirShah]]
----
Sunir--it's not clear to me what you think we should be doing, or what momentum we had.  Should we just ask people to write a script that will put up automatic links to FOLDOC (and now [[PlanetMath]], it seems), when a Wikipedia topic is the same as a topic in FOLDOC and [[PlanetMath]]?  I think that's a very interesting idea, and maybe indeed we should do it.  Maybe you could make the proposal on [[en:Wikipedia:Mailing lists|Wikipedia-L]], or do the coding yourself? --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I'm not going to get involved in the internal affairs of Wikipedia. As a non-community member, I am only willing to work at the periphery. If no one is willing to work on this, then it won't be done. I assumed someone was interested in trying this, but I no longer am sure that's true, so I'm not going to press it.

Meanwhile, the last couple weeks have seen some major improvements in wiki technology on [[MeatBall:MeatballWiki|MeatballWiki]], like [[MeatBall:KeptPages|KeptPages]] controlled [[MeatBall:PageDeletion|PageDeletion]] and file updating, and a [[RichSiteSummary]] mod_wiki extension, so I'm working on that. If someone wants to go further, then can contact me directly or ask on [[MeatBall:MeatballWiki|MeatballWiki]] where others may assist. -- [[SunirShah]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this page (which is open to redefinition, since all are encouraged to edit) is not to supplant any debate on Wikipedia-L but to complement it by directly analyzing the nuances of the GFDL as they may apply to Wikipedia.

''Note: at present ([[October 28]]), the following is written by a single Wikipedian, [[The Cunctator]], edited in two instances by SJK, and now with this comment by LMS.  The fact that it is written mainly by one person does not, of course, mean that it is necessarily a biased presentation of the issues.  But please be aware that this does not represent an &quot;official workshop&quot; on the issues raised by the page.  In particular, please be aware that these issues have been discussed publicly by many other people, and will continue to be discussed in the near future, on [[Wikipedia-L]]; please see the relevant [http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-October/date.html mailing list archive] to see how this debate has proceeded. --[[Larry Sanger]]''




=== Required copyright and license notice ===
The GFDL requires use of a copyright and license notice. Here are possibilities
for their use.

==== Copyright ====
Everyone who contributes to Wikipedia is a copyright holder. The only way we could change this would be for each person to legally assign their copyright. So we should simply say something like &quot;Copyright &amp;copy; 2001 Wikipedia Contributors&quot;. See also '''Authors''' below.

To get each person to legally assign their copyright to a single entity for what has already been written is essentially impossible. But in the future, authors could be asked to assign copyright to some entity upon submission.

However, there is also [[compilation copyright]].

==== License notice ====

The parts that can be varied are in italics.

1. The least restrictive version of the copyright and license notice.

  Copyright (C) 2001 ''Wikipedia Contributors''.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with ''no Invariant Sections'', with ''no Front-Cover Texts'', and with
  ''no Back-Cover Texts''.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.

2. Requiring a link-back:

  Copyright (C) 2001 ''Wikipedia Contributors''.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being ''link.html'', with ''no Front-Cover Texts'',
  and with ''no Back-Cover Texts''.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.

link.html:
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.com&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;

However, requiring a link-back may be redundant, because compliance with the GFDL requires a &quot;publicly-accessible computer-network location&quot; of a &quot;transparent&quot; copy of the document.

Modified versions have to include a network location for previous versions unless they're a modification of a version which is more than four years old.

In other words, people already pretty much have to link back to Wikipedia.

=== Secondary Sections ===
The only sections which may be designated as invariant are those which are secondary; which means that they &quot;contain nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.&quot; See Questions below.


=== Other Sections ===
The License defines particular sections

==== Acknowledgments ====
Optional, but if included in the original, the substance and tone of the acknowledgements must be preserved in modified versions.
  [[Wikipedia Acknowledgements]]

==== Dedications ====
Optional, but if included in the original, the substance and tone of the dedications must be preserved in modified versions.
  [[Wikipedia Dedications]]

==== Title Page ====
&quot;the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text&quot;

In modified versions, it is necessary for the Title Page to include the names of the principal authors; and for the History section to include the title, principal authors, and publisher. Thus, we need to clearly define title, authors, and publisher.

==== History ====
This is the publication history of previous versions, only necessary in modified versions. See title, authors, publisher.

==== Endorsements ====
Optional, but this section cannot be included in modified versions.
    [[Wikipedia Endorsements]]

=== Entities ===

==== Title ====
What we consider to be the title should be explicitly defined. Is it HomePage? Wikipedia?

Or are we asserting that each entry is separately released under the GFDL, so that the title of an entry may be considered as the title for the purposes of GFDL compliance?

==== Authors ====
To allow people to publish modified versions in compliance with the GFDL, we need to add some commentary to define what we consider to be the primary authors.

Possibilities:
* &quot;There are no primary authors.&quot;
* [[Wikipedians]]

==== Publisher ====
The publisher must be explicitly mentioned for people to successfully meet the requirements of the License. In particular, the publisher must be mentioned on the History page. Also, the GFDL states the publisher may grant certain permissions (see below).

Possibilities:
* Bomis

=== Mechanism for Granting Optional Permissions ===
The GFDL explicitly states that the publisher and authors may grant certain permissions not automatically granted by the License; they include:

The publisher may grant these permissions:
* Publishing a modified version with the same title as the original
* Omitting a network location for public access to a &quot;transparent&quot; copy of the original
* Replacing cover texts originally added by the licensee in an earlier modificatication

The copyright holders may grant this permission:
* Replacing Invariant Sections with translations

----
== Questions ==
==== Q. What exactly is being released under the GFDL? ====
Are we releasing the entire Wikipedia.com site, the whole tarball, under the GFDL, or are we also releasing each individual entry under the GFDL?

Factors in releasing only entire site:
* It's a lot simpler for us.

Factors in releasing individual articles:
* Makes reuse much easier for others
* Thus, increases GFDL &quot;infection&quot;

:There is little or no difference here. If you release each individual article under GFDL, you can combine them (the GFDL has provisions dealing with the combination of separate documents into one document). If, on the other hand you release the whole site under the GFDL, then you can always delete all but one article to make a Modified Version. -- SJK

1. There's actually a major difference, because you can have different invariant sections, cover texts, and other sections if you have different license set-ups. Thus, the whole Wikipedia could have a set of invariant sections/cover texts etc. that the individual entries do not.

More specifically, certain pages (like the HomePage) could have more ancillary materials than the average entry.

2. Another major difference: if the entries are released individually under the GFDL, you can copy them individually under the Verbatim Copying clause; if the License covers all of Wikipedia, then doing that would fall under the Modifications clause.

3. Another major difference is perhaps (we need a legal expert to answer this) Wikipedia can have a [[compilation copyright]] holder, while individual entries have the Wikipedia Contributors copyright holder. Fortunately, the GFDL obviates most need to deal with copyright holders; just about the only one the publisher can't handle is that Invariant Section translation issue. It would be a good idea to resolve that explicitly (perhaps by not having Invariant Sections).

There will probably be a few major instances of reuse for Wikipedia:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Instance&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Entries licensed individually&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;One single licensing&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1. Copying an individual entry&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;verbatim copying&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A modification of the whole entity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2. Copying from an individual entry &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;modification of single entry&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A modification of the whole entity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3. Using Wikipedia as a database &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Combining documents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A modification or verbatim copying of whole entity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4. Putting parts of Wikipedia into book form &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Combining documents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A modification of the whole entity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Note especially the difference in #1, which is important, because that is the predominant use of Wikipedia by individuals.

==== How do translations of English Wikipedia articles for other language Wikipedias need to be handled? ====
Right now, it's being handled informally, pretty much assuming that all the Wikipedias can share and share alike, and people should give references. In the future, it would behoove us to ensure that we are in compliance with the Translation section (#8) of the GFDL. What will be necessary to do that depends on how exactly we implement the license.

=== Is there anything on Wikipedia which can't fall directly within the overall subject of Wikipedia? ===
The only sections which may be designated as invariant are those which are secondary; which means that they &quot;contain nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.&quot;

What is the overall subject of Wikipedia? While the answer isn't directly answered, from [[Wikipedia policy]]: &quot;Wikipedia is an ''encyclopedia''&quot;. From [[encyclopedia]]: &quot;an encyclopedia is a written compendium of human knowledge.&quot; So we may reasonably infer that the overall subject of Wikipedia is &quot;human knowledge.&quot;

See also [[What Wikipedia is not]] and [[Do fair use images violate the GFDL?]]

One amusing paradox is whether the pages about Wikipedia (e.g. [[Wikipedia policy]]) fall directly within the overall subject of Wikipedia. In a certain real sense, pages about Wikipedia (including [[Wikipedians]] and individual Wikipedian pages) fall directly within human knowledge.

But this sense is certainly stretched to its limit when one considers most /Talk pages. 

It would be similarly unreasonable to consider a required link to Wikipedia to directly fall within the overall subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why do you keep putting ... back on the drop-outs page? He's taken great pains to remove himself from Wikipedia. I'm not going to get into an edit war over it, but its pretty obvious that he doesn't want to be there. STG

----
I don't see why we should respect the wishes of people who are no longer participants in Wikipedia, especially if the wishes regard deletion. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

I look at it like this: if the page was &quot;Politicians who have criminal records&quot; and some politician didn't want to be on the list, I wouldn't honor that wish. In short, this is information which belongs to society, not to the individual. That's pretty righteous, I know, but this is crucial knowledge if Wikipedia is to have any means of self-criticism. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

----
Well, I wouldn't compare contributing to Wikipedia and having a criminal record, but hey... I'd rather you'd let him leave in peace, but I doubt that either of us will convince the other. Besides, I'm hungry and want some supper. 

I will say this, though, just so you know where I stand: even though I've had some strong disagreements with you, I recognize that you were motivated by a deep concern for the Wikipedia project, and I appreciate the massive amount you have contributed. I disagreed with your methods, but never questioned your motivation. --STG
----
I admit my analogy had some, er...amusing implications. But I doubt the mention of [the handle] on this page will haunt the person who used to use that handle (note: they're not the same thing!).

[deletion]

----
I chose the title for the page. I didn't expect it to be perceived as non-NPOV. After all, isn't a drop-out simply someone who decides to drop out of a project? The usernames of contributors who quit are perhaps useful, but they are not essential to understand their motives for quitting. I think we should refer to them namelessly, should they request it. --(name withdrawn ;-)
----
I just think it's beneficial to Wikipedia to understand why people leave. How is the page not NPOV? Is it the title?

The drop-out list is as extensive and complete as possible. I'm not personally aware of any other members who have stated that they are leaving.

I'm not trying to attack the person who wants all history of his presence erased personally, I'm just not currently convinced his desire to erase his presence outweighs the reasons to include the username on the site. I still hope he'll email me at kband.com.

I too don't think it would be bad if the name was removed/obscured if someone (preferably that user) wrote the story of why he left, so the rest of the community knows. That's more important than the username (which is needed for verifiability, unfortunately).
----
[deletion]

I imagine that some people think there are Wikipedia-related political aims behind this page, and that's ''why'' they don't want to be listed on it.  Their removing themselves from the page, in that case, should be construed as a desire not to support those political aims, not as censorship.  This being a wiki, I would say that's their prerogative, and that you should respect it. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
[deletion]

I totally agree with you that people should be able to remove themselves from Wikipedia (or any other wiki) if they so desire. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

: I continue to believe that people are not synonymous with their usernames, and should not have ownership over them (except to prevent mistaken identities, perhaps) after they stop contributing. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

[deletion]

I think that a list such as this would be far more useful if it were used to catalogue the reasons people leave, as opposed to the people themselves. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
----
Good point, Stephen. The whole of this should perhaps be moved to a page titled something like &quot;Reasons for leaving Wikipedia&quot; (and edited accordingly). --[[user:Seb]]

----
I'd also like to point out that much of the page implicitly assumes that someone leaving is a bad thing, or that someone's leaving implies there's something wrong with Wikipedia or the process.  If someone comes to Wikipedia thinking it is one thing (like a community for the free exchange of ideas), and then leaves because he doesn't want to support its actual goal (creating an encyclopedia), then that's a good thing.  [[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]
----
It's just allright to have a censor like LMS, but many people are put off by his insensitive aggressive behaviour
:''I think LMS is usually sensitive. He is critical but seldom aggressive. Of course it all depends on what one considers aggressive. This list would quickly get much lengthier if he was.''</text>

Wikis don't work if people aren't '''BOLD'''.
You've got to get out there and make those changes, correct that grammar,
add those facts, make that language precise, etc. etc.
It's okay.
It's what everyone expects.
So you should never ask, &quot;[[en:Wikipedia:Why Aren't These Pages Copyedited|Why aren't these pages copyedited]]?&quot;
Amazingly, it all works out.
It does require some amount of politeness, but it works.
You'll see.

If someone writes an inferior or merely humorous article or article stub,
or outright [[en:patent nonsense]], don't worry about their feelings.
Correct it, add to it, and if it's a total waste of time, outright replace it
with [[en:wikipedia:brilliant prose|brilliant prose]] (and relegate the deletions to [[en:bad jokes and other deleted nonsense]] or the corresponding [[en:talk page]]).
That's the nature of a WikiWiki, and long live [[Wikipedia]]!

For the most part, the instinctive desire of an author to &quot;own&quot; what he has written is counterproductive here, and it is good to shake up that emotional attachment by making sweeping changes at will when it improves the result. 
And of course, others here will boldly and mercilessly edit what ''you'' write.
Don't take it personally. They, like all of us, just want to make Wikipedia the best it can be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical|2001}}''Although the first major milestone is a year away, it's beginning to sink in for me how significant the [http://web.mit.edu/ocw/ MIT OpenCourseWare project] is, and how it will affect Wikipedia. I'm including a comment from John Lienhard and some comments from students as background.'' &amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[user:tbc|tbc]]

Did it sink in for anyone else that professors are lining up to publish their text books as part of OCW? (It didn't for me--until today. If only 10% of MIT's professors are as magnanimous as Prof. Lienhard, what a difference it will make for knowledge dissemination!

Making textbooks available for viewing online matters most to the poorest in the world (provided they are one of the five billion [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Literacy literate] people and also have Internet access, but that's an obstacle to discuss another day). But ever for those who already have an education -- including bachelor's graduates like me -- OCW means we will have inexpensive access to higher quality educational materials that support our own personal lifelong learning goals!

''More TBD.'' &amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; [[user:tbc|tbc]]

-----

From http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2001/ocw-fac.html:

:Why do I support OpenCourseWare? Last year, I posted my undergraduate heat transfer textbook on the web for no-charge distribution. It is a 700 page pdf file, fully hyperlinked, and also properly typeset. In the domestic book market, the cost for this book would be $85 for the hardback or $45 for the paperback. My aim, however, is to provide the knowledge to those who can't afford to buy the book. The book has been downloaded by users from around the globe. Those users include many professors and students at remote universities in the third world. But the book is also being downloaded by students at universities in the United States and engineers in domestic industry. So the reach of my ebook has been quite broad. I therefore have every reason to believe that MIT's OpenCourseWare Initiative will immediately gain such a worldwide reach, and that it will allow MIT to expand its influence to students, teachers, and technical professionals, domestically and, especially, in less-developed nations. -- John Lienhard, Professor of Mechanical Engineering

From http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/2001/apr11/ocwside.html:

:...

:I am a Nigerian student who has dreamt all his life of studying in MIT. Thanks a lot for making this dream come true, for if I can't come to MIT, MIT has now come to me.&quot;

:&quot;What I saw from your initiative is the possibility of a major global upgrade of education -- professors in the US and around the whole world, including those in little Uganda where I am from, will be inspired and motivated to be on par with MIT standards. The students will demand it because they will have access to high-end quality education, giving them opportunities for a better life and better access to other opportunities.&quot;

:&quot;I write this letter to convey my best wishes for the success of your OpenCourseWare program. I am resident in India, and would have given anything to have had access to such a facility when I was a student. I used to be frustrated when I wanted to learn and could not afford to buy books or simply did not have access to such books in local book shops.&quot;

:&quot;Knowledge should be free for those who want it. In the long run, it will speed up the progress of mankind.

:&quot;This is the most important news I have read in a long time. You have changed the world with one bold move.&quot;

:...
----
In the long run, Wikipedia's going to be even more important--or so I hope.  I've just written an article for http://www.opensourceschools.org that argues just this. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]</text>

&lt;big&gt; Jan '''2002''': #24 below has been chosen as our new logo! &lt;/big&gt;

'''This is where suggestions for a new Wikipedia logo should go'''&lt;br&gt;
''(The old logo is 113x110 pixel, the new one should be about the same size)''

----
Hey, I made a logo that is like the current one (which was decided after the rest of this page was created). I hope you use it, becuase the current one (the supposed NEW one) looks dull. Black and white... ugh.

:Not to mention that it looks rather too much like a logo for an AT&amp;amp;Tpedia. :-) --[[User:Larry Sanger|LMS]]

----

''There are a half-dozen or so of the following that I would be perfectly happy with.  There is one possibility that no one has yet generated, viz., the present logo with the words &quot;Wikipedia&quot; and possibly also &quot;The Free Encyclopedia&quot; superimposed, somehow.  Send me your opinions either below, on this page itself, or privately in e-mail (lsanger at nupedia dot com).  I will use my best judgment in coming to a decision, and do my best to make the most people happy. --[[User:Larry Sanger|LMS]]''

Well, they are too large to replace the current logo. That said, they are nice by being plain and direct, but IMHO a little too plain (what is that blue bar trying to tell us?), and they remind me of the [[http://www.bayer.com Bayer]] logo, which might lead to copyright problems ;) --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

The logos are wide but not very high (522 x 42), intended to be left-justified at the top of the screen (just like I've done at http://susning.nu/). The blue is a little too dark, and the logos are perhaps a bit over-simplistic, but you might use them as inspiration.--[[user:LA2]]

===15===
[[image:sodiumlogo2.png]] (second attempt by [[user:sodium|sodium]])&lt;br&gt;
'''Comments''': This is just about my favorite so far.  Some minor reservations, though: &quot;the free encyclopedia&quot; font seems a bit messy.  The apples might help a bit, but something else up there might be better.  Other ideas: book spine; old-fashioned key; a rocket; the outline of a forest, city, or college campus skyline; a quill; a stylized web. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I get associations to fruit-flavored chewing gum. I would restrict the use of colors to white and just two more.--[[user:LA2]]

===16===
[[image:sodiumlogo2.1.png]] ([[user:sodium|sodium's]] second attempt at his second attempt)
'''Comments''': The whole 'series' is nice, though I still couldn't figure out what the apples or the city are for. The latter could be the 'wikipedia community'? --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
:Well if you understood Magnus, the logo would immediately disappear and be replaced by something far more complicated (a bad Hitchhiker's Guide paraphrase). - [[User:Manning Bartlett|MMGB]]

----
General comment: many of the logos have a W in them; I don't really see the point. Just because Wikipedia starts with a W? I think a globe with letters, or a book, would be more appropriate. Actually, I kind of like our current logo. Maybe with &quot;Wikipedia&quot; on top and &quot;The free encyclopedia&quot; below? We could also have a version with a red &quot;You can edit this page&quot; across. 

Another concern is that a logo should only use very few colors since on many browsers the overall number of different colors is limited. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

I'd like to see logos of the sort Axel describes.  (To answer the question, though: yes, just because &quot;Wikipedia&quot; starts with a W.  We don't need a better reason; it's a logo!  But of course, the W isn't necessary, either.) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

===17===
[[image:yy_wiki_g01.png]]
'''Comments:'''&lt;br&gt;
I like the look of this one a lot. However, I suspect the wiki community at large would get after us if we used this particular version, since we're the only wiki that is an encyclopedia. --Stephen Gilbert
:I think you mean &quot;we're ''not'' the only wiki...&quot;  Another very interesting design, with the advantage that it'll look good on black and white reproductions.  The problem, of course, as Stephen hints, is that we aren't just a wiki and we shouldn't advertise ourselves as ''the'' wiki or as ''named'' &quot;Wiki&quot; (or &quot;Wiki encyclopedia&quot;--that's not the name!).  One other problem (not to detract from the nice design!) is that it reminds me of moonlight streaming in from big windows, which gives it a spooky sort of feel--not a feeling we want associated with Wikipedia. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

'''September 9, 2007:''' The other year, when I was trying to improve the help pages of the Swedish Wikipedia, I found that many pages had been started from an existing technical mechanism in the software, such as templates. Even though templates are very general purpose, their use has evolved into a few strong categories such as navigation boxes, infoboxes, source references, etc. Infoboxes and their subvariety taxoboxes in biology are in fact older than templates, since they started as simple HTML tables, copied into each article. So rather than writing a help page for templates, I wrote a help page for infoboxes, trying to describe how they were used for a purpose (what and why) rather than which software mechanism they were based upon (how). There is a definite date when support for templates was introduced in the software. The same goes for MediaWiki's table syntax and categories. But very similar use patterns predate these introductions: designing tables with HTML or preformated text, and using list pages as a precursor for categories. The '''entire system of tools for structuring''' the world's knowledge (as is Wikipedia's goal) can be fully understood only if we '''document the historic evolution''' of these mechanisms, use patterns and their associated policies. This reasoning is not limited to Wikipedia. On Wikisource, the use of scanned page images and proofreading instructions predate the introduction of the &quot;Page&quot; extension. Categories are used not only for arranging articles by subject, but also for indicating quality standards and grouping articles with deficiencies (such as stubs). Maybe Wikibooks and Wikinews has similar patterns?

So, is anybody documenting this historic evolution of tools? When reading through the [[w:History of Wikipedia|History of Wikipedia]] article on the English Wikipedia, it strikes me that this article writes the history, rather than writing about the history from a distance. There are references to a few history papers, such as Larry Sanger's recollection of the early days, but nobody seems to have written the History of Wikipedia outside of Wikipedia itself. So the WP article is very much &quot;original research&quot;, which it shouldn't be. With Wikipedia still in its first decade, perhaps that is asking too much. But two thirds of that decade have past, and maybe its time to think about writing the history. Why not start on Wikibooks? My own interest would focus on the technology, tools and policies used to organize knowledge on a large scale. This is not just the history of the Mediawiki software, but also how the software features are used by the large Wikipedia community. Someone else might prefer to write about social interaction between users or certain kinds of social and systemic bias, such as gender issues.

The closest Wikibooks project that I have found is ''[[b:Wiki Science|Wiki Science]]'', but it is a little too wide in scope. Looking around Wikibooks, I'm getting depressed by all the half-started and abandoned projects. This makes me think twice about starting a new Wikibook project, since I don't want mine to be among the abandoned ones. Maybe inactive and unfinished projects should be removed (deleted or pushed out of sight, to the &quot;attic&quot;), to improve the quality of the average project? I'll leave these thoughts here for now and see if they mature.</text>

The availability of MetaWikipedia has certainly had an intersting effect, and one that I would not have predicted a month ago.

For one thing, I've certainly noticed a dramatic increase in civility over at Wikpedia. 

Now maybe this is just my perception, but the &quot;inflamed and passionate harangues about Wikipedia policy&quot; seem to have subsided considerably, even though there is no logical reason for them to have done so.

Either we are too lazy to hit the &quot;Meta Wikipedia&quot; button conveniently located on &quot;Recent Changes&quot;, or perhaps those issues weren't so desperately important after all.

Or better yet, maybe we are all too busy writing articles now? Whatever the cause, I think that this makes MetaWikipedia a good thing.

[[MMGB]]
----
It seems that more effort is going into the articles over at Wikipedia Proper, so MetaWikipedia is good in that way. However, I'm finding that our current implementation of it is getting in the way of Wikipedia discussion, and since that is the purpose of this wiki that's a bad thing. For example, there is no easy way to link to Wikipedia pages. InterWiki links would help a lot. However, I'd like to see the meta discussion move to a separate namespace on Wikipedia, with a separate Recent Changes page. --[[User:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

----
I'm totally with you on the interwiki links - Magnus said he plans to implement something like that once he finishes his exams in late Dec 01. I don't think it really makes a difference whether it is on a separate domain or a separate namespace, as long as we can inter-link easily. - [[MMGB]]
----
I think having Metawikipedia in a separate namespace (&quot;separate&quot; meaning &quot;with a different 'recent changes' page&quot;) is a good idea--I was never opposed to that. In the meantime, it's not hard to link to a page on Wikipedia. Just go to the Wikipedia page and do an &quot;external link&quot; to it. It's not hard.

I totally agree that Wikipedia seems more civilized now, and this is a very good thing. --[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
Now that Larry's gone, it seems to be the only form of [[governance]] left.24

I&quot;m still here, 24, assuming the role that Larry had from before. Please log in.
--[[Jimbo Wales]]
:Not if you are interested in community and reputation. From my point of view, this is a market not a community, and it benefits from sharp trading not from groupthink. We do not have physical shared risk here, so there is no real reason to trust each other. In fact, a strict protocol that works so well that we never have to, seems to suit the encyclopedia form much better.
:if you are assuming this role Larry had, then, please, outline how you think [[governance]] works.

November 21, 2001, 11:30 AM -- There've been a lot of interesting lists of information added to Wikipedia over the months, and we've had a few more than usual added in recent weeks, it seems.  These include lists of political parties, lists of popular names, lists of shoguns, lists of popes, lists of famous actors, etc.  It's easy to make a list, and relatively hard to do the research or brain-racking that writing a detailed prose article requires.  This isn't to criticize the making of lists, just to explain why they've been added so much.  Lists do, of course, contain essential information that belongs in Wikipedia, and thanks to everyone who has been working on these entries.  Every bit helps.

But we should bear in mind that Wikipedia is about ''a lot more'' than just making such lists.  ''Nobody'' is under the illusion that Wikipedia is or ought to be just a collection of lists; but we should bear the main task in mind.  In most cases, the articles pointed to by the items on the list contain as it were the &quot;most important&quot; content that we are developing.

Moreover, I hope we'll bear in mind that some of these lists--in particular, the lists that are constantly changing, year to year (so, not the list of popes)--are essentially almanac information, more than traditional encyclopedia information.  Traditional encyclopedias have issued &quot;yearbooks&quot; which would contain updates to articles and almanac-type information.  Moreover, you can look in any almanac and see hundreds of lists of information like this (e.g., populations of American cities, tax rates of states, popular baby names, etc.).  I do think Wikipedia should contain such information, but we should be careful about adding information that we cannot easily maintain.  All such lists require careful, constant updating to remain useful and accurate, and as a community, we still certainly lack the resources (in terms of personnel) to ensure that some such lists remain accurate and useful.  Eventually, though, we very well might have enough people to keep such lists up-to-date.

Anyway, this is all just food for thought.  I just wanted to put this list-making behavior in context, not to condemn it.  Really, I think it's important work, and every bit helps.  My two cautions are: remember that Wikipedia ''isn't just'' about making these sorts of lists (it's mainly about writing full, prose sentences in full, well-structured paragraphs, in [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/The_perfect_article complete, well-structured articles]); and remember also that some information that you might be adding now in list form might need updating in six months, and if you're not around to update it, who will?  That worries me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:For the Wiki Dictionary, see [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page Wiktionary]

Before continuing, let me say that I firmly agree with the policy on Wikipedia NOT being a dictionary. However, one of my favourite sites is Infoplease [http://www.infoplease.com], which includes a dictionary. What makes it work is that the search engine clearly labels the source of the items (Encyclopedia vs dictionary).

So one day, I would love to see a '''Wikidictionary''', interlinked with the Wikipedia and sharing a common search engine (that was able to label retrieved items accordingly). I would definitely want it under a separate domain, with it's own environment, because I wouldn't even want them to link together until it was worth a damn. I think it ties in with the concept of the Wikipedia being a &quot;resource of knowledge&quot;. Anyway, that's just my opinion. Let me repeat - I am NOT interested in turning the 'pedia into a dictionary as well - this would be a separate project under a common banner. - [[MMGB]]
----
An old idea...the work is already being done, I think ipooped all over my techer
 under an open content license.  Anybody remember where?  How about an URL? --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Excluding indications of pronunciation and grammar, what makes a short Wikipedia entry on a simple one-word topic distinct from a dictionary entry? If the content does no harm, why put restrictions on it? -- [[user:sydhart|Sydhart]]

Actually, a separate Dictionary that can be linked to the other parts of Wikipedia makes a great idea, and a model already exists in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary at http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com. This dictionary consists of three pieces: a interactive piece that sits on your computer, and - when you are on-line - it looks at whatever word your mouse is pointing to, goes to the on-line dictionary, and - so far - translates the word into Spanish. The translation shows up as a popup attached to the mousepointer, and it works everywhere, even directly on the Desktop or third-party software. The other piece that gets downloaded to your computer is a cookie that identifies you to the server. The third part is the dictionary itself on the server. These three pieces work together, and a broadband connection seems mandatory. The interactive piece also adds plug-ins into your browser, and into the Mousepointer, to let you launch the server frontend in a seperate window.

'''This page is largely obsolete, and describes the 'phase II' version of the wiki software, which ran on the English wiki from January to July 2002 and on the Meta wiki until October 2002. For more current info, see [[en:Wikipedia:PHP script]] and elsewhere.'''

''This is a list of new style features under the PHP script, of UseModWiki features that are not supported under the script, the reasons for that, and a discussion. Be aware that some of these features will not work here, because the meta-wikipedia software version is usually some days or weeks behind...''
 
==New and intentionally changed features== 
===Automatic heading numbering=== 
As you can see in the line above, headings now get a number. This is not a bug (as some might think on first glance), rather a new feature, which can be turned off on your user preferences page. The reason is that, now that the subpages are effectively gone, and with topics becoming more mature than stubs, articles may become longer. 

To structure long articles, headings and subheadings are very useful. But, as HTML goes, the headings are not very easy to tell apart (e.g., h3 vs. h4). The auto-numbering will detect the &quot;highest&quot; heading present (on this page, h2) and assign it with the main counter (1,2,3...). &quot;Lower&quot; headings get a sub-numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... 2.1, 2.2, ...), and so on. This can be very helpful in longer articles (for an example, see [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/wiki.phtml?title=Signal_transduction]). 

It does mean two things: 1) People are going to have to change some habits, and 2) It's going to make some of our current articles look screwy (see [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/wiki.phtml?title=September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack]).
:Actually, that article looks &quot;screwy&quot; because the heading tags were not used for headings, but for big bold text. Anyway, I'll figure something out.--[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

Also, it can ''later'' be used in other ways: 
* Show a &quot;table of content&quot; at the beginning of a long article. 
* Make headings &quot;jump points&quot;, to link to a specific location within an article (the &quot;a name=...&quot; tag). 
These features are ''not'' implemented yet! 

===Link extension===
[[Foo]]bar is &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo]]bar&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the source, but displayed like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo|foobar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Saves a lot of time;)
 
===Paragraph justify=== 
A setting on the user preferences page makes the text in wikipedia articles &quot;justified&quot;, meaning it aligns on both left and right side. It is turned off by default to allow for maximum similarity with UseModWiki.

===International wiki links===
You can now link to the same topic in a different language. For example, in the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Vikings]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; article, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[de:Wikinger]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will link to the German article about the same topic, which is (guess what) &quot;Wikinger&quot;. These links will not display within the article, but at the top of the page.

===Interwiki links===
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Biology]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to the biology article at wikipedia. From there, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[m:Format issues under the PHP script]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will link to this very page. ''(Or was it &quot;meta:&quot;? I forgot...)''
 
===Variables=== 
====Variables that are replaced upon saving==== 
Currently, only the ~ ~ ~ signature thing. 
====Variables that are replaced upon display==== 
These are all enclosed in {{ }}. There are only a few so far: 
* NUMBEROFARTICLES inserts an estimated number of articles. 
* CURRENTMONTH inserts the current month as a number. 
* CURRENTMONTHNAME inserts the current month as text. 
* CURRENTDAY inserts the current day as a number. 
* CURRENTDAYNAME inserts the current day as text. 
* CURRENTYEAR inserts the current year.
These were originally intended for use on the Main Page (automated date change, article number update). ''Later'', there can be variables to organize article categories, and automatic crosslinks to the same topic in other language wikis. 

Two new category variables:
* CATEGORY, followed by a blank (space) and a comma-delimitered list of categories that an article belongs to. These are not displayed within the text, but at the bottom of the page, as well as in the sidebar.
* THISCATEGORY displays a list of all pages that have a CATEGORY tag with the name of the current page.
 
==Removed or altered features== 
===CamelCase is gone=== 

 
===Subpages are gone=== 
Per LMS decision. You can still use and create pages that have a &quot;/&quot; in the title, though. This causes problems for current entries which depend on the automatically generated link back to the main entry, such as [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/wiki.phtml?title=September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attack/US_governmental_response].
:I made a new conversion script that will append a backlink to the &quot;main topic&quot; if (and only if) there's no such link in the article anyway. So, all subpages will get their backlink to the &quot;main topic&quot;, it just won't be an automatic one (and can thus be removed where unwanted).
 
===Missing parser functions=== 
Some features from the UseModWiki parser do not work here, or work slightly differently. The HTML generated by this script is more compatible with XML standards than the HTML from the UseModWiki (e.g., ''li'' tags now have a ''/li'' end tag). If you miss anything in particular that works in UseModWiki, please list what it is on the [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/wiki.phtml?title=wikipedia%3ABugs bug report page] and why you like/want/need it.</text>

:''The discussion below primarily covers [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:The_future_of_Wikipedia&amp;oldid=288197 August 2001] to May 2003.''

I think that we have grown a Wikipedia community. [[w:Wikipedia]] is a [[w:volunteer]]
project that was made possible by [[w:Bomis]]. However, we have invested in our
favourite project a lot of enthusiasm, time and (in some cases) money.
It is quite natural that we '''want''' Wikipedia to prosper.&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion it is a time to stop and discuss. Discuss the future of
Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;
How does Bomis see it ?&lt;br /&gt;
How do '''we''' ?&lt;br /&gt;

The future might be or might not as bright as our imagination whispers
into our ears.&lt;br /&gt;
Wikipedia is a great idea combined with a new, revolutionary software and
it has a lot of brilliant committed authors. Her growth is explosive.
But there are also weaknesses (Wikinesses ?) brought to light by some
of us.

=Scalability -- do we need distributed solutions?=

There are two ways of Wikipedia growth - global or niche.&lt;br /&gt;
If we decide in favour of global growth - being slashdotted only first symptom of a serious problem.&lt;br /&gt;
I'll give you my ([[w:Kpjas]]) idea :
:Nowadays distributed software solutions are the height of fashion. Why not devise a distributed Wikipedia? Programmers ?
::We cannot &quot;distribute&quot; editing a single article, as that would result in several different versions of the very same topic in different locations. ''One reason to build wikipedia is to avoid exactly that!'' Of course, wikipedia could be split into &quot;topic&quot; groups, but even if we can decide which topic goes where, why should we do that? Not every fashion is worth following! --[[w:user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
:::Having multiple versions isn't a bad thing, infact, it lets every user vote on what article is best. If there were an rss style feed between the P2P nodes, notifying user's systems of updates to subscribed articles (rss is a pull technology, I believe), every client, would also be a server for viewed pages, and possibly volunteer to hold other's pages, but the point is that I could subscribe to _all_ or _selectively subscribe_ to your wiki subscriptions, and my other friends. I trust you, and your friends.. rephrased, there would be a network of trust. (my computer is a bout a line behind as type, sorry I can't fix mistakes) http://escargot.icehouse.net/mediawiki/ then fractodendron ... fractodendron can also use servers to just collect article .. er diff notifications, and the users get the diffs from the peers.

=Multimedia=

The [[Special:Upload|upload page]] has solved this for the time being - people just need to use it!

=Internal data format=

This point is connected with '''Software''' issue below.&lt;br /&gt;
Current data format is otherwise an example of excellent software solution.
But understandably the creator of it did not envision the scale of Wikipedia.
It poses numerous problems like searching through Wikipedia and others.&lt;br /&gt;
:My ([[w:Kpjas]]) thoughts wander around [[w:XML]] data format in connection with a free [[w:database]] like [[w:MySQL]]. And your thoughts ?
::You're reading text from a MySQL database right now:) XML would be &quot;fashion&quot; again, a useful one maybe, but it would become harder (=it would take longer) to edit a page. I might add a XML export function some day, if there is demand. --[[w:user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
:::(This is done: [[Special:Export]]) [[User:R3m0t|R3m0t]] 12:00, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=Software=

Like any other open software project the software behind it should be free and
open to all.&lt;br /&gt;
The same applies to Wikipedia software. As I said above wikipedia software
(usemod wiki) is a revolutionary and of very good quality but
needs of Wikipedia as a global encyclopedia of unrestrained growth go beyond
that kind of software. See also above Internal data format.&lt;br /&gt;
On the Wikipedia mailing list [[w:BryceHarrington]] proposed making the Wikipedia
software publicly available on [[w:CVS]] for further collaboration on its
development.

=Commercial and organizational issues=

I'm no good at it. But to me it seems to be one the most important issues,
second to wide netizen involvement.&lt;br /&gt;

Please, share your feelings and opinions here.

* Nupedia and Wikipedia - obsolete

Even if the Beta stage part of my suggestion isn't deemed worthwhile, I still think it would be a good idea to periodically (semi-annually or anually) make a frozen &quot;stable&quot; version for bibliographical and archival purposes (see the modifications in my comment above).

--[[w:Matt Stoker]]&lt;br /&gt;
I think that when the wikipedia has existed for a year it will be time to take a look. Who knows how big it will be by then? I have already captured one of the data tarballs, but don't know how often it will be updated. -- [[wwmike dill]]
-----------

I agree that for sustained expansion some organization is needed. At a minimun a clearly articulated vision of Wikipedia that rapidly and correctly introduces new browsers and potential contributors to the community and its [[w:social contract]] or charter. I have started a general discussion section regarding this issue at :[[Discussion on business models and organizational charters applicable to large free wikis]]. Perhaps the ideas and writings which have merit locally can be moved into a draft business plan and/or charter here at meta.wikipedia. Then after discussion and widespread consensus has been reached it can be appropriately ratified by the community and owners/sponsors and published on Wikipedia.com to reduce misunderstandings. [[user:mirwin}

=Moving beyond the web=
I think Wikipedia needs to move beyond the Web.

While an effort has been made to minimize the amount of HTML needed to edit pages they haven't been truly 'abstracted', and there's still a lot of non-portable HTML formatting in the database (for things like tables especially).

If an effort was made to completely separate content and presentation (by using XML to markup page content and removing all instances of hard-coded visual formatting) it would be much easier for people to leverage the database for non-web purposes (e.g. Wiki on cell phones and PDA's, Wiki incorporated into computer programs, etc.).

This doesn't, I don't think, mean we'd have to reinvent the wheel. HTML could still be used (since it is essentially XML), but tags and attributes that deal with formatting and layout should be disallowed and perhaps some Wiki-specific tags could be invented (e.g. a &amp;lt;refrences list&amp;gt; tag, so those common elements could be treated differently in different Wiki implimentations).

=Ensuring/Maintaining Article Quality=

Issues related to the continued improvement, reliability, and control of articles in Wikipedia.

== Wikiversial and DORS ==

Here are some ideas on a possible new approach to wikipedia:
http://idiki.dyne.org/wiki/Wikiversial&lt;br /&gt;
http://idiki.dyne.org/wiki/Distributed_Oligarchic_Rating_System &lt;br /&gt;
Wed Feb 8 19:48:47 CET 2006

== Wikidebate ==
Just a thought that it would be possible to make a ''wikidebate'' or ''wikiopinion'' community so that people posting opinions and debate in wikipedia have a place to discuss hot topics. This would be basically a seperate site from wikipedia as a seperate wiki. Whether this would end POV disputes in hot topics or not is uncertain. This could also include a functional ''wikiblog'' connection. Bloggers could post and link to other blogger's posts. Most primary opinions would be locked and be similar to a NYTimes article but the water cooler discussions could take place in a wikidebate forum with POV defended on each side. This certainly seems like something that could be done on a [[Three-year plan|3 year scale]]. It has been seen that people want their POV seen and others want to discuss it, why not let wiki have a place for POV seperate from areas already designated as NPOV. --[[User:Dave moeller|Dave moeller]] 22:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

==Reliability==

The other side of the free writing style in Wikipedia is quite possible
lack of reliability.&lt;br /&gt;
This lack of reliability would in the end undermine Wikipedia's credibility and
ultimately her success.&lt;br /&gt;
This issue must be tackled, and as soon as possible. I don't agree here with
[[w:Larry Sanger]] and his view &quot;self-healing&quot;. It is an example
of elated wishful thinking that is misleading us.&lt;br /&gt;
I'd rather agree with [[w:Piotr Wozniak]]. His ideal of reliability is EB and
he is anxious about the potential lack of it in Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;
I am very interested in other people views. To start the creative process of
discussion I'll give you my ([[w:Kpjas]]) idea :
:Why not create two parallel Wikipedias one '''public Wikipedia''' that is almost frozen (apart from ''Talk'' pages, ''Feature requests'' pages and the like). And the '''working Wikipedia''' for contributors. Foreseeing your criticisms of the proposal that it would hamper netizen involvement - ''Edit this page'' could lead into the working Wikipedia.
::I'm pretty sure that this is exactly what will eventually happen: every Linux distribution will come with a frozen, local, HTML-only version of the Wikipedia. Clicking on an edit link will direct you to wikipedia.com. --AxelBoldt
:::What a brilliant idea ! This should be done ASAP. It is obviously a superb way of bringing to Wikipedia an influx of new authors !!!&lt;br /&gt; BTW There should be two packages - client and server. The server one could be put on intranets and LANs. Imagine what knowledgable engeeners at [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]] could add to Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;--[[Kpjas]]
:see the nupedia answer below
:There will be a &quot;stable&quot; namespace in the PHP wikipedia that can only be updates by chosen users. That could be converted into &quot;real&quot; HTML pages, once a day or on demand.--[[w:user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

This system is too slow. How do you decide when moving an article from the working Wikipedia to the public? And what do you do when a small change is made (i.e. a typo) is corrected?

Another solution would be to have articles that are &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;accredited&quot; by experts in the field. Often, wikipedia isn't taken seriously by universities and other academics because the articles aren't peer reviewed like normal encyclopedias. If some real experts in the field could be the administrators of articles relating to their field, and the articles were marked as &quot;certified&quot;, when a researcher cites those articles in a paper, it would have more clout and make wikipedia a more respectable source of information.

The most organic solution as I see it is an evolution of the trust metric idea of [http://www.advogato.org/trust-metric.html Advogato]. Solving this problem, incidently, opens up very intriguing possibilities for new forms of governance. Self-healing is a valid concept in the long run, given an underlying commonality at our core as human beings. Yet it seems many are quite distant from that commonality, creating situations where humanity acts out against itself, much like confused cancerous cells. Is resolving this issue beyond the scope of the wiki project? --[[User:Dreamer|Dreamer]] 04:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

==Editorial process==
Much has been said about it but not much done.&lt;br /&gt;
We have an excellent and hard-working editor-in-chief - [[w:Larry Sanger]] but
I think Wikipedia in current form needs several such editors and when it
reaches 100,000 pages 1000 Larrys.&lt;br /&gt;
My idea ([[w:Kpjas]] is :&lt;br /&gt;
:Create editor teams online that would cross national Wikipedias borders. The teams would need tools to work effectively. One, the simplest, in terms of setting it up are separate mailing-list devoted to editorial groups like [[Architecture]], [[Philosophy]] and so on.
::I'd say the best thing is to have several editors that are ''not'' assigned to a specific field, but work together on common topics and have their self-defined specialties. I'm a biologist, but my specialty is biochemistry, which means I know nothing of the different wing spans of all the bat subspecies, but (a little) about organic chemistry. Wikipedia is run by mutual trust, and we should trust the editors to stay away from judging topics they are not qualified to judge.--[[w:user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

:::I agree totally. See [[Referees#Collegiate approval]]. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 16:06, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Are new admins quitting faster than ever before. Is Wikipedia stagnated. Or are they all terrible lies

==Caution: peer review can slow progress to a crawl==
[[w:MichaelTinkler|MichaelTinkler's]] comments
Who is going to choose the 'contributor' group as opposed to the 'reader' group. Do we know that there is a reader group anyway? I have a distinct feeling that those using wikipedia are those who are contributing.

The self-healing model is an incredibly optimistic one that depends on a civil society of the web to work. I am (so far) incredibly impressed with it, sleep/learning aside. I have had no trouble with my submissions; many of them have been improved by editing and additions (thanks rmhermen!). P.Wozniak's idea that the best writers are the least tolerant of others edits may mean that I am not a very good writer. Or that humility is a virtue that all of us, however good we think our writing or contributions are, have to cultivate if we're going to participate in a Wiki-format encyclopedia. If a contributor wants to feel pride in ownership as well as craftsmanship, that contributor should, at present, find another venue¿Nupedia, for one.

There is in my field (Early Medieval Europe) an excellent peer-reviewed project, the Ecole Initiative (http://www2.evansville.edu/ecoleweb/). The peer-review editing process has slowed its growth to a C-R-A-W-L. One thing I like about wikipedia is that I can dash off a fairly stupid little biographical entry and then come back and flesh it out later. I'm building up a network of 8th and 9th century entries which are starting to satisfy me. Every now and then someone else takes a stab at 'em, and I'm grateful.
[[w:MichaelTinkler]]

==Evidence against self-healing theory?==
I'm sorry, but this drive for increased hierarchies, control, and rules is
crap. Wikipedia doesn't need anal retentive people to chain and gag it. Read
Hackers by Steven Levy to get some understanding of the difference between a
free, open project driven by pride and quality, and the standard fear-driven
system led by administrators, bureaucrats, and incompetents. Calling the
&quot;self-healing&quot; theory &quot;wishful thinking&quot;, without any evidence to back up your
derision, is galling. I do support the distributed Wikipedia, and maybe trying
to figure out multimedia, but that's rather ugly.
--[[w:The Cunctator]]
:Please be moderate in your appeals for unrestrained author's activity on Wikipedia. This could ruin results of hard work of many Wikipedians. Please consult [[w:What Wikipedia is not]] and follow the rules.&lt;br /&gt;--[[w:Kpjas]]

: [[w:Kpjas]] illustrates the classic problem with anal-retentiveness . . . anal-retentives can't comprehend how they appear to others. They don't have the capacity to step outside their world view and imagine how destructive their effect on others can be, and how they look to others. Fortunately the &quot;What Wikipedia is not&quot; page [[w:Kpjas]] refers to has been deleted, but his brusque, in fact rather rude, command to [[w:The Cunctator]] to &quot;consult&quot; an [[w:Anal retentive]] page and &quot;follow the rules&quot; illustrates what i think is the major challenge Wikipedia is going to face in the near future. I entered discussion after encountering several instances of competely unwarranted targeting for deletion based on absurd, nit-picking claims by people who clearly have no idea how pompous and control-freakish they make themselves appear. Perhaps we should call it the [[w:Get a life]] issue? I think the broader Wikipedia community will have to address it if Wikipedia is to avoid developing a reputation as a censored, blinkered information source that can't be trusted to include the whole story, the interesting media resources, etc..

: I agree with [[w:The Cunctator]]. [[w:Ignore all rules]] was the greatest achievement of wikipedia. [[User:LARS|LARS]] 09:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Nature, through its evolutionary history, seems to have already solved this problem of &quot;rules&quot;. Its solution is a balance of both. Starting from nothing but the laws of physics, it has evolved a more-or-less harmonious, orderly ecosystem. Yet, within it, each being holds an immune system which imposes certain order on each cell to prevent the organism from turning into goo. Wikipedia ''could'' go on with &quot;Ignore all rules&quot;, but the energy that would have to be expended by the current simple immune system may become so great that it would perish and go extinct. To understand nature's immune system is to see the solution to this problem. --[[User:Dreamer|Dreamer]] 04:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

==Having &quot;Stable&quot; and &quot;Development&quot; versions==
:''Main article: [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Stable versions]]''
I agree that some manner of ensuring Reliability would be a good thing. However, my implementation would be slightly different. Rather than a '''Public''' and '''Working''' Wikipedia, I would recommend a '''Stable''' version and a '''Development''' version. This emulates the development of open source software, where a stable (hopefully bug-free) version is periodically released for users, while the latest and greatest development version is also available to anyone interested in adding to the code or who is willing to take the risk of using a possibly less reliable version.

In my implementation, the '''Stable''' version would be frozen for a period of time (perhaps a few months, up to a year) and then updated from the '''Development''' version. The difficult part is determining what should be updated. I would suggest that shortly before the update, the '''Development''' version would go into a '''Beta''' phase, where wikipedians were encouraged to compare the development version of articles to the stable version to ensure the update would really be an improvement. The advantage of this approach is that authors would not have to constantly monitor their particular subjects to make sure an error wasn't added by someone else, instead they'd only have to review their subjects periodically against the stable version (during the Beta period).

It may also be worthwhile to impose some controls during the Beta period, such as only allowing editing of the talk pages, so these articles are relatively stable. People would then get a chance to review the beta articles and perhaps vote for or against them. Articles facing significant opposition would require review by Larry or other editors prior to being incorporated into the stable version. In this case the new development version would be released at the start of the Beta phase, so those who so desired could continue making contributions.

Having a set of &quot;Stable&quot; versions would be useful in the event of widespread vandalism (perhaps by a malicious script), since the last &quot;Stable&quot; version could simply be restored instead of having to sort through each individual article to find the last non-vandalized version of that particular article. In addition the &quot;Stable&quot; versions would be useful for the purpose of bibliographical referencing, since an author who quoted text from Wikipedia could cite it as (Wikipedia, v1, 2001) and wouldn't have to fear that the quoted text would be changed. In other words, text may change in future stable versions (e.g. Wikipedia, v2, 2001), but the text in (Wikipedia, v1, 2001) would never change.

--[[w:Matt Stoker]
:A very, very interesting suggestion. Does it lead to some sort of Wiki-CVS?

Matt's &quot;stable&quot; version made me think that it could be a good
idea to have periodic &quot;snapshots&quot; of wikipedia. Each page has
its history, but I'm not sure exactly how it works, and it is clear
that not all the history is saved. It might have some archival
value, or could be consulted in case something is inadvertidly
changed, and the version needed is not availabe on the history any more. I would not be practical have it like a &quot;live&quot;
wikipedia, but a compressed tarball every month or so, doesn't
sound too farfetched too me. All the voting stuff though... i think there has been enough talk about editorial controls, aristocratic or democratic...the system seems to be working as it is.--[[w:AN]]

==Letting local experts &quot;freeze&quot;/&quot;unfreeze&quot; an article==
Why not using some kind of voting? I mean, let say some very good historian will do excellent page, some other will improve it, and few others will see that it is good and there is no need to change it. Or that there is article, where after heated debate some consensus have been achieved. Then there come some new user (or some user who isn't new at all) and change everything as he likes. Yea, of course anyone can change it back, but perspective of watching every article is frustrating me. 

Why not just after _many_ persons, without specifying who has right to do tat or who is not, would vote that that article is stable enough to be considered brilliant prose and further changes can't be made without consulting, and they have to be requested in some way? No small editor team, just few random people who worked on the article earlier.

Take some example: There is country named Beaveria. Some person, nice lady named Elisabeth Jones, is thinking that it is centre of the world and all her contribution are biased, But few other reasonable guys, Bear Giggler, Pavel Wetter, JFK and others agreed to construct entry which is quite NPOV and complete. But nobody of them had patience to deal with constant changes from Jones or random newcomers who will all the time change their carefully chosen words, and watch that article every day (watch list is cool, but i mean not everybody had a will to lose time over and over again - sometimes is hard to track down what change was done to article, if i would be a vandal, i would just cut and paste whole text and chacking that would be really difficult..). So those few vote that article is good enough to be stable and moved to stable part of wikipedia and all other further changes are to be put into request page first (beaveria:request_change or something) or to beaveria:beta_page.


These are just ideas floating through my head while i am waiting for my program to end compiling, but maybe something of that could crystalise into something useful? [[w:user:szopen]]

Agreeing - &quot;The self-healing model is an incredibly optimistic one that depends on a civil society of the web to work&quot; but we don't have any bridge to that civil society if we adopt strictly academic, or economic, or populistic criteria. What this really says is that wikipedia needs a [[value system]] of its own, even if that is hard to characterize in objective terms. For instance we might say that we do not intend anyone to be enabled to do direct harm to others based on what's written here, i.e. we would not explain how to make anthrax. We might also say that we consider it essential to &quot;trickle down&quot; konwledge from the over-priveleged over-civilized &quot;[[w:developed nations]] to the under-priveleged struggling angry debt-ridden &quot;[[w:developing nations]] - all pretty non-controversial goals of real world &quot;[[w:civil society]]&quot;. So I don't mind the optimism as long as we are aware that we cannot do this if we do not understand and respect the world views of such political neutral groups as [[w:Medicin Sans Frontiers]], [[w:World Wildlife Fund]], [[w:Amnesty International]] who make a cult out of [[w:harms reduction]] and [[w:neutral point of view]]. We could do much worse than adopt their criteria or even invite them to form an editorial board and pour in their considerable knowledge of field medicine, ecology, and peacemaking activity.

Nothing wrong with optimism. We definitely need some [[visions]] here too to balance the [[threats]], real or imagined, that some people seem to see under every [[w:cosmology]] or [[w:foundation ontology]] - as if people believed in these things simply to make wiki's job harder. We have a diversity problem and a [[groupthink]] problem too, e.g a small clique or cult of [[w:particle physics]] believers and [[w:Karl Popper]] devotees who don't actually see how seriously deranged most of the world sees their [[w:dualism]] and [[w:reductionism]] to be. Certainly no [[w:civil society]] thinks that way.

To me the future hinges on this point of tolerance for diverse views that do not appeal to minds trained in Western mathematics and physics, incapable of perceiving moral or ethical foundations to reality as such, as most people in the world do. Some further discussion on [[three billionth user]] issues may well be in order. Over the long run, keeping track of [[threats]], [[visions]], [[best cases]], [[worst cases]], and the [[status quo]] in terms of those is going to be essential just to know what the heck we are doing now.

==Reputation systems to attract serious contributors from academia==
I've been doing a little lurking and editing at various wikis over the past couple month. I've been thinking about the the nature of open-source collaboration, as defined by ESR in The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Also, A professor I'm working with at OSU is currently the Editor in Cheif for the upcoming edition of the Encyclopedia of Religion. 

It seems to me that what's missing from the current wikipedia model is a reputation system. That's one of the incentives of open-source work -- that you gain recognition and respect for the work you've done. This is what drives most academics -- certainly not pay, but their influence in their respective fields. 

The benefit of the reputation system is that newbies to the system know where to go. Start with the big names in the field. So, when you first log on to wikipedia, there is a slashdot-style filter that only shows highly-rated content, or content from highly-rated contributors. 

There would be two kinds of ratings: content and contributor. 

Actual content itself will be rated on its own merits, regardless of its contributor. (Note that content ratings will reflect on their contributors reputation, though.) This way an anonymous, beginning contributor who makes useful contributions will not have their work filtered out. However, there has to be a system to rate new, incoming content. This requires some work. 

A contributor will have a rating, too. There are three parts to this: the sum rating of their collective contributions, personal ratings granted by other wikipedians, and finally, personal vouchers. 

The collective rating will help independent, armchair experts who do not necessarily have any expertise recognized outside of wikipedia. As they contribute more, and their contributions are recognized as valid, their reputation in the wikipedia will improve. 

The personal rating is kind of a shortcut for the collective ratings. If you've read enough stuff from a person, you've come to the conclusion that they know their stuff, they're serious about contributing, and they are unlikely to troll, then you can rate that person. 

Finally, the personal voucher is for recognition of an expert new to the wikipedia system. For instance, a well-respected and highly recognized professor who's new to wikipedia might one day decide to contribute some articles. Instead of wasting time building up a reputation the traditional way, other wikipedians can give personal vouchers to the newbie. It's sort of like instant credit. Face it: the internet has a bad name in academia as far as research ( I remember in my undergrad days a few years ago, professors would specifically tell us not to use the internet -- not that you couldn't find good data, but too many students were careless with the quality of their sources ). Ideas like wikipedia *scare* scholars who are used to peer-reviewed journals and the reputation systems in academia. 

The goals of this reputation system is 

1. To reduce the workload of editing and removing trollish content. Users with high reputations will require less oversight. Filters would prevent crap from being presented in the first place. 

2. To improve the quality of content for newbies. Default filters can be set high for casual browsers. 

3. To increase the incentive for contributing. For instance, my professor at OSU likes the idea of the wikipedia, but probably won't be adding any content. Why not? Because there's no gain in it for him. In his line of work, reputation is everything. If he can't get recognized for his contributions to wikipedia, he won't do it. Why should he waste his time?

4. To better implement the idea of peer review from previous knowledge-seeking endeavors. 

So, all in all, I think a reputation system would make for higher quality content on the wikipedia. I'm aware of Nupedia (currently defunct) -- but they seem to *only* want Ph.Ds. My system doesn't discriminate between those recognized outside of wikipedia, and those whose expertise is only apparent in the wiki world. [[User:Lawpoop]]

This system uses an algorithm that approaches democracy, non-bias, and balance of information. It is somewhat reminiscent of Google Page Rank, which gives priority to websites based on several factors, including the quality of links from other sites and their Page Ranks. Using a similar algorithm, contributors and content could be rated based on several factors.

==Reputation system: Must be simple (''kudos'' based?)==
:[[User:Lawpoop]] — I think you're on the right track and several of the other contributors on this page are converging on similar ideas. A few comments I would add:

:I'm a [[w:dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] when it comes to turning on such a system -- there annointed time is not yet come as the median quality of articles is still low &amp; we are better served by letting lots of wild and wooly editing go on for now. I do think the need will continue to grow over time though.

:With regards to a heavy-duty peer-review system, I'm sceptical it would ever be heavy duty to cause professors/academics to list their wikipedia contributions on their CV. I say this because I suspect that wikipedia will never be able to out peer-review the professional peer-reviewed journals. We don't have anywhere near the mental horsepower, especially since all our horses are volunteer horses. But that doesn't mean the general idea of peer-reviews is bad, I just don't think it can be made weighty enough to get the seal of approval of the professional academic community.

:Something closer to the ebay reputation system may make more sense -- the main thing is that '''it has to be easy'''. Perhaps a '''kudos system''' -- if you see a previous edit you admire, you click a kudos button located somewhere on the diff page. If you're a respected wikipedian your kudos are worth more. Or even if the editor has not received any kudos but he's made a number of edits over a number of days he's trusted to some degree.

:But a user rating system is only half the battle as I'm beginning to realize. You're not done until you come up with a article rating system (which must be based on the user rating system (how else can we rate articles if we don't rate wikipedians who review those articles? -- there is no way). What is the best model for a page that is going to have restricted editing applied? Is the model '''cold, colder, coldest''' reflecting progressively higher accomplishment (and requiring correspondingly high level wikipedians to edit)? Or just two states: '''frozen''' (requiring a group-decision or some level expert to unlock) and '''open-edit''' (any newbie can cut their teeth on it). 

:... or is The Cunctator right — a free and open society with a minimum of controls is the best we can do?

=Suggestions=

I'm not sure if such possibilities already exist, but I was wondering three things for possible future Wikipedia adaptation or spin-offs:

1) Is there a collaborative site already available where people can voice their ideas and dreams on any topic (e.g., ideal software not existing, ideal modifications to existing software, invention ideas, artistic or musical concepts that were offered to others to develop, etc.)? Although Wikipedia may understandably not be designed for this, I would think that in addition to having discussion pages for each page (which mostly focused on editing comments about the information page), it would be conceivable I would think to add a link for each page to link it to a free-for-all discussion on the topic and/or to a &quot;future visions and concepts&quot; page (e.g., concepts and future visions of furniture, Star Trek, political reform, etc. etc.). Wikipedia has evolved such a nice categorization scheme, I think it is a pity not to be able to use it as an umbrella for other topics (like a fully collaborative Yahoo but without users needing to know HTML to submit their pages).

--Reply: here it is: http://idiki.dyne.org/

2) Are there plans in the future for Wikipedia to be able to host collaborative databases which could be flexibly edited, searched, browsed, and sorted? For example over at Wiktionary, it would be most useful, I think, to have a collaborative database to be able to edit, search, browse and sort a database of the most common words of various languages all at once (i.e., our Swadesh list). However, countless other sites could also benefit from database interactivity. Knowing little about the technical challenges to this, all I can offer is that I understand Filemaker Pro allows databases to be hosted interactively. Perhaps it or something like it could be accessed from within Wikipedia/Wiktionary.

3) As I mentioned on the Wikipedia freeware discuss page, I thought it would be nice to keep track of more commercial items (in a neutral way of course) such as by listing all software available by platform and by whether it is freeware/donationware/crippleware/etc. (or any other type of commercial product--like a collaborative &quot;Consumer Report&quot;), as existing sites dedicated to this purpose may either include advertising, consist of misleading propaganda by the company, or otherwise be not able to benefit from a collaborative process (e.g., by allowing the evolution of more refined categorizations of content, etc.). - [[User:Brettz9|Brettz9]] 21:00 8 Apr 2003 (UTC)

4) Is no one thinking about the slightly further out evolution of Wikipedia that possibly or probably will occur? Looking at the logarithmic growth curves of the data and article count, does it not seem likely that Wikipedia will continue to grow and eventually become a unified single bank of all human knowledge? And would the world wide availability of this knowledge not allow advancement of knowledge to grow at an ever faster rate than previously? There seems to be so many positive feedback systems in the concept of Wikipedia that it's never ending growth to a point where it encompasses all knowledge seems almost inevitable. 

In regards to quality of information I think this will only be a small problem and will only delay rather than prevent Wikipedia becoming a resource such as this. Campaigns should be launched to encourage professionals, academics and anyone who has a certain specialist knowledge to contribute to Wikipedia. Although ideally such a project as Wikipedia would have no advertising I think discreet and targeted advertising should be introduced to fund such campaigns. I think Wikipedia in the next decade has the capability to revolutionise the knowledge industry worldwide and in doing so create an economic gain equating to several percent of worldwide production.
 
However, in tearing open the knowledge industry it may also cause a reduction of writing by academics for lack of incentive either by recognition or money. Therefore it is probably important that systems should be introduced to allow recognition and monitory gain from inputs. Whatever the case I think this is an incredibly exciting time in the development of human civilisation to live and we should take more time to contemplate this and look towards the future. A satisfaction must be created in the addition of information to what is probably to become one of the most important revolutions in human society. What is it that separates us from animals if it is not the knowledge that we posses. 


Two more suggestions...

1) How about the option to send the registered users emails notifying them of new additions to their watchlist (whether only for specific ones or any items, as changes are made, in a daily/weekly digest, etc.)? The Wiki site &quot;Netunify.com&quot; has this option.

2) Combining the watchlists for Meta-Wikipedia, Wikipedia, and Wiktionary, etc.? (So a person doesn't need to log in to each separately).

- [[User:Brettz9|Brettz9]] 21:04 8 Apr 2003 (UTC)

What about a wiki to collects such things as maybe song lyrics, or film scripts?
Also, a inter connectivity in between wikis would be most profitable (like links from Wikipedia articles to Wiktionary ones).

''Talk for an entry put in by someone about their own site (see [[w:Wikipedia:Historical Wikipedia pages%2FTalk%2FGamefoolz]]) which broadened into a discussion of the appropriateness of the class of such entries.''

Ok, I'll bite: why is this page being restored? Are we going to allow everybody to drop by and plug their web sites? --[[STG]]
----
STG: Gamefoolz is for the bettering of humanity with it's humorousness. So this resource is --in the process of-- explains why you should have humour, and a site where to get it.
:I have nothing against your site. See below for my argument. --[[STG]]
----
The /Talk page would be the place to try your best to resolve the &quot;should this page exist?&quot; dispute amicably.

My view on this--I don't think it does any great harm to have a page devoted to Gamefoolz. We wouldn't want to have a page about every website that comes down the pike; Wikipedia Is Not A Web Directory (see [[what Wikipedia is not]]). But Gamefoolz is a big site, and we should be able to humor them even if some (or even most) of us think there's no point in including articles about large-but-not-famous websites.

Approximately the same thing would go for articles about companies. Eventually, when Wikipedia has a million articles, ''every''-friggin-''body'' is going to want to have articles about their businesses. Your Mom and Pop shop might not merit a mention even at that point (although, at that point, we might be set up to have an encyclopedia-style business directory; who knows?), but some mid-sized retailer, for example, probably would. If it made them happy, let 'em.

I don't feel strongly about this, by the way. I could easily be convinced otherwise. --[[Larry Sanger]]

----
I feel more strongly. Wikipedia Is Not A Web Directory, or a review forum, or a place for what is, essentially, content that belongs on the About page of a website. That's the point of having web space -- you can say whatever you want about your site, ''on your site''. Wikipedia is not the place for meta-information on websites; that role is well served by web directories and the websites themselves.

I don't see that the corporations analogy is entirely appropriate. An encyclopedia article about a corporation is useful because people will not necessarily expect to get information ''about'' the corporation ''from'' the corporation itself; a corporation is not necessarily a place to get information. A website, on the other hand, is technically nothing ''but'' information; if it has something to say about itself, it can be said on the website, and people will more readily look to the website itself than to an encyclopedia article about the site.

Please, let's make this clear (perhaps in Policy, if it's not already). -- [[Bignose]]
----
But you concede, surely, that we should have articles about [[Yahoo]], [[Excite]], and [[Slashdot]]. So...? --[[LMS]]

: I don't necessarily concede that, no. What is it we can say in an encyclopedia that isn't better said, and located, at the site itself? I feel that anything approaching comprehensive coverage of the subject turns us into a Web directory; anything brief and pointer-like turns us into an ancillary web search. What are the advantages of encyclopedia articles for Yahoo, Excite, Slashdot et al, that are not already met by the sites themselves? -- [[Bignose]]

:Tsk tsk, Larry, what an argument! :) Let's apply it to other topics:
*'''People:''' We should have articles on [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Mozart]], therefore we should also have one on my cousin [[Kal Thomas Gilbert]], a garbage collector in Toronto who just moved into a new apartment.
*'''Events:''' We should have articles on [[World War II]], the [[Big Bang]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], therefore we should also have one on [[What Stephen Ate for Breakfast, March 12 1996]]
:Er... I'll stop there. If you happen to think that the above arguments hold up, you should know that I don't actually have a cousin named Kal Thomas Gilbert]], and I doubt that I can remember what I ate on that particular day, so I can't write the articles. ;-) --[[STG]]
::''(Ack! We '''don't''' have an article on the Protestant Reformation! Off to Requested Articles I go... --[[STG]]''
----
Here are my 2 cents- 

1. Why are you discussing this here? Surely actual information about Gamefoolz would be much more relevant/informative than this argument.

2. They do seem to be a large website, but perhaps it needs just a little push to make it big. So what if we make 1 little entry about a webpage? If it does grow huge, then it would warrant the same attention as a Yahoo or a Google. I say, why not? What harm does it do? Don't give me crap about how &quot;this isn't a directory&quot; and such, give me reasons.
-----
I think the question to be asked is &quot;is this website particularly significant?&quot;. Yahoo is significant, due to its millions of users, its long history, it was one of the symbols of the dot.com boom, its declining share price... Similar things can be said about Excite. Slashdot is important in a particular subculture. I doubt (though I will admit that I don't actually know) Gamefoolz has anywhere near this significance, no matter how good its content may (or may not) be. In which case I wouldn't include it as an article. -- [[SJK]]
----
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but it has the potential to be ''much'' bigger and ''much'' more detailed than any other encyclopedia. I say, let's not think small. Let anyone put an entry for anything they want. We should spend our energy not in discussing whether to remove such pages but instead on editing the pages to make them [[NPOV]] and to make their written style more &quot;encyclopedia-like&quot;. --[[Eob]] 

: No argument on that point, certainly. Perhaps I'd look more kindly at such articles if they became, as you say, more NPOV, factual, and encyclopedic in content instead of an &quot;About Gamefoolz&quot; page. If someone who knows the subject can massage it such, I'll be happier. -- [[Bignose]]

-----
Who's going to edit them into shape? Is it anyone? It won't be me, or a lot of other people I would think. The original authors of this kind of page -- Gamefoolz.com is only one of a larger category -- never put in much effort, and what we get before editing is generally worse than nothing at all. Editing them into shape is tedious and less-than-rewarding; why should we reward half-assedry? -- [[Paul Drye]]
----
I think this is a borderline case. One issue is the potential for spam. I disagree with part of [[Bignose]]'s argument, that information about websites is naturally best found at the website. I'd hardly expect Yahoo to have an [[NPOV]] article about the history of Yahoo, for example. But I do agree with [[SJK]] that the importance (or lack thereof) of the site matters. And I agree with [[Paul Drye]] that we ought not to reward half-assedry.

One truth about Wikipedia is that useless pages tend to not get much traffic. No one will link to them. If we ignore them, they quickly sink into unlinked obscurity. If Gamefoolz turns out to be more important than we currently realize, then links to it will naturally appear in other contexts.

Many of these same arguments could be had about an article about my grandmother. She's a very notable person in my life, and in the lives of people who knew her, but from the encyclopedic point of view, an article on [[Erma Leon Dudley]] is pretty pointless. If it's a lame article, so much the worse. (Especially since only a small handful of people in the world could even attempt to edit it with an eye towards accuracy.)

But again, the big issue here is spam. No one is likely to have a particular motive for writing a hagiography about their own grandmother. But websites and product manufacturers will have an increasing incentive over time to monitor the entires about them and work to edit them into their preferred mode. That's bound to happen someday, and we're bound to have to fight it.

It'll be interesting.

But for now, I'll come down with a vote on the side of letting this one slide. --[[Jimbo Wales]]
-----
From the main entry:
=== An Explanation of the &quot;purpose&quot; of Gamefoolz ===
Gamefoolz aka gfoolz is (as stated before) a humorous page, [[humor]] is good for you as it provides one of the simplest forms of [[entertainment]], if we (as in, the world in general) did not have humor, the world would be a boring place, so us friendly folks at Gamefoolz try to do our part of cheering you up and we hope you enjoy it while you still can.
----
If word gets around that Wikipedia is a great place to promote your website, we will be flooded with people throwing up similar articles, and leaving us to edit them in accordance with Wikipedia policy. We had a similar situation when someone tried to use Wikipedia to advertise a compression program called FAR. The pages were promptly removed, and I see no real difference here. Let's nip the problem of spam in the bud, instead of waiting until we have a huge mess to deal with. --[[STG]]

: Seconded. -- [[Bignose]]

:: Thirded. The writing in this article (and on their site) is semi-literate at best and utter gibberish at worst. (Their site, by the bye, is utterly devoid of the humor they claim to be their ''raison d'être''.) Kill this article a lot. --[[The Epopt]]

----
I agree with EOB, as long as it fits the &quot;encyclopedia format&quot; then why not? This is supposed to be a special encyclopedia thing, right? Then why limit it to stuff you can find in any normal encyclopedia?? That just doesn't make sense, and, to me, seems rather narrow-minded.

:Tiresome and deeply naff though this site may be, I see no real problem with its inclusion. If you really ''must'' know what Gamefoolz is though, you probably aren't using Wikipedia... [[sjc]]

----
Two comments:

One - I think this discussion has moved beyond the specifics of Gamefoolz and has broadened into a deeper policy issue. It would be a good idea to devote a discussion to it on Wikipedia-L or on metawikipedia.

Two - I do not have any problem with people creating articles that discuss their commercial ventures. We do not want to attempt to prevent people doing it - it is a war we will lose. A much better alternative is to simply edit the articles of poeple who do so into something [[NPOV]]. A comment like &quot;WebsiteX claims to be the number 1 basket-weaving website, though industry statistics strongly contradict this&quot; or &quot;the CEO of company X has recently been charged with insider trading&quot; will probably make being actively featured at Wikipedia less desirable. Companies like to have control over their marketing, and at Wikipedia they will have no control whatsoever.

Having said the above - I will still happily delete articles which are clearly just advertising copy, as was the case with FAR. That article mentioned pricing and ordering details, so it had to go. 

As regards this article: the current Gamefoolz article is not very interesting, is dreadfully written and frankly makes their organisation look rather amateurish, so it is actually not really to their benefit in any way. Numerous requests have already been made to improve the article, and sooner or later an editor will finally swoop down, remove all of the sub-literate parts and rewrite the 1-2 sentences which aren't too embarassing to read and actually have some content. This will not be an act of &quot;information suppression&quot; but merely an act of editorial cleansing, as could happen to any article on any topic that has not been improved, after multiple requests to that effect. - [[MMGB]]
----
My latest thought... perhaps we should develop some loose criteria whereby a website is considered _important_ in some way. An important website is one that deserves an article. An unimportant website is one that doesn't. But keep in mind that by many measures, Bomis isn't important. :-) Neither is wikipedia. :-) --[[Jimbo Wales]]
----
The last two observations are quite insightful. Unless we nuke those articles (or move them over here on Meta), we're going to have to either accept a lot of websites or have a double standard. The criteria for acceptance are going to be difficult to agree on, IMHO, because just about everyone thinks his own turf is important. --[[Seb]]
----
I suggest that Google could provide a standard for inclusion: sites that score well (for sufficiently defined values of &quot;well&quot;) can have pages, sites that don't, can't. For example, entering &quot;link:http://www.gfoolz.com/&quot; into Google gets &quot;about 23&quot; hits, while entering &quot;link:http://www.slashdot.org/&quot; into Google gets &quot;about 38,300.&quot; --the Epopt
----
I just saw this page and read the last few entries, and it seems to me the problem is that we should make a difference between a ''website'' and the ''organization or company behind it''. IMHO, there shouldn't be an article about a website, but about a group/oragnization/company/etc. important in some area, which ''then'' has a link to their site. A page about [[www.defenselink.mil]] is pure nonsense, but about [[U.S. Department of Defence]] is not. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
----
Your point, Magnus, is a good one, but how would you handle Slashdot? It is an important site, if only for its ability to drive traffic thither and yon, but I could not possibly care less about Commodore Burrito and the rest of the organization behind the site. (I'm not arguing with you; I think you're on to something. Just trying to define it a little more precisely.)
----
I think we should use this standard for inclusion: if someone writes an entry about a site, then there should be an entry about the site. We can apply standards of quality to the entry--if it's poorly written, uninformative, etc., it should be edited mercilessly, but I think we can have the inclusion criteria be whether someone put in the time and effort to include it. If someone writes a script to automatically add websites to the directory, that should be stopped, but otherwise, I think we only need to worry about neutralizing tone. 

Enforcement of neutral tone should be strict and swift. I think how the Gfoolz entry looks now is a good example of that.

Popularity should not be a standard for inclusion. The popularity of a site will be reflected in the popularity of that entry--e.g. the Slashdot entry will have a lot more links to it than the Gfoolz entry.

--[[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
Maybe we could say there should be only articles about ''the organization, company, insitution, or community'' behind web sites. That would include Slashdot as well. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
----
It's a combined page for the organisation and its website: for DoD it will be mostly about the organisation, for Slashdot it will be mostly about the website: not much problem I think.

The standard of inclusion needs to refer somehow to &quot;significance&quot;. Something may be unique in a technical way even if hardly anybody has heard of it. Something popular can also be considered significant simply on account of its popularity.

Not many people will want to NPOV garbage pages, I guess: there should be no such obligation when deletion will solve the problem (somebody else can always write it again properly if the subject has any significance).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Concerning the &quot;user classes&quot; you listed, keep in mind that we will introduce a &quot;stable&quot; article namespace at some point. There might arise the need for a &quot;user class&quot; between &quot;editor&quot; and &quot;consumer&quot;, some &quot;specialist&quot; category, to (somehow) approve wikipedia articles into that namespace. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

Magnus - I'm using the concept of &quot;user classes&quot; purely as a means of organising my thoughts around what information resources are needed by users at any one time. This usage differs from the traditional IT perspective, which relates user classes to &quot;rights and privileges&quot;. At the moment, everyone can perform activities related to all user classes - we can link pages to &quot;Page titles to be deleted&quot; which is an admin role, we can contribute to policy discussions (a management role). Conducting a &quot;management activity&quot; is a completely separate concept from &quot;being management&quot;.

For my benefit, and from a functional perpective, what different actions could the &quot;approvers&quot; perform? [[user:Manning Bartlett|Manning Bartlett]]

My suggestion (we did discuss the matter, but we didn't really decide on it) was to have an &quot;approval&quot; and a &quot;stable&quot; namespace. Many people (e.g., every logged-in user) can ''advance'' any article to the &quot;approval&quot; namespace. The &quot;approvers&quot; (a few &quot;specialists&quot;) then decide about these articles to be either approved to the &quot;stable&quot; namespace, or not. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
-----
Hey, Manning, this is interesting, but it isn't what I was asking about.  :-)  The issues weren't about metadata ''about Wikipedia the project,'' which is already well-enough organized for now, I guess.  The issues were about metadata ''about individual Wikipedia articles.''  Should we keep track of authors?  ''Must'' we keep track of authors?  Etc.  There are many other issues. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]</text>

'''#24 has been chosen as Wikipedia's new logo!'''

For history's sake, here is the discussion that led to #24 being picked as the winner, a discussion held between mid November and early December 2001. The ultimate winner was also the last horse to enter. For a while there #7 looked like the winner. 

===1===
[[Image:newlogo1.png]] (from [[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]) &lt;br&gt;
'''Comments''': Nov 20 - I dislike the emphasis that this logo (and the ones below) places on &quot;Editing&quot; - Wikipedia is ultimately a knowledge resource. - [[MMGB]]&lt;br&gt;
:As I have the vector format &quot;sources&quot;, all the &quot;Editing&quot; parts can be easily removed.--[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
I like this one, as it offers a concise description of the project. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
:I kind of like this one myself.  &quot;The free encyclopedia&quot; doesn't stand out enough, though. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I like this one best, except the color is not quite my taste, and the bottom text should be a bit bigger. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

I vote for 1, 10 and 24. Of these I like 10 the most because it stands out, is easily recognizable --TK

===3, 4===
[[Image:newlogo2a.png]] [[Image:newlogo2b.png]] (from [[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]) &lt;br&gt;
'''Comments''': 
:New version. Better? --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
:Much better. I think that the &quot;You can edit this page right now&quot; sentence detracts from the image; I'd like to see it with that part removed. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
Now? Now? :) --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
:Another improvement, I think.  One distinct advantage that this one has is that it has the same sort of design approach as the [http://www.nupedia.com Nupedia] logo.  sounds good... trying this for the first time..

===6, 7===
[[Image:sodiumlogo1.png]] (early attempt by [[user:sodium|sodium]])
[[Image:sodium_var.png]] (Stephen's small modification of sodium's first logo)&lt;br&gt;
'''Comments''': I quite like this one - understated yet distinctive. Well worth developing as an idea - [[MMGB]]&lt;br&gt;
I like this one best so far. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
:Gimp layered source if anyone wants to play with it - [[http://meta.wikipedia.com/upload/sodiumlogo1.xcf]]. -- [[user:sodium|sodium]]
:Â¶ Of the suggestions here, I like this one. Logotypes need to convey a simple message very fast. Several of the other suggestions have too many small details in them. Also, the childishness/humor/irony of some other suggestions do not quite work in a logo. Companies don't have logos that say their products barely work.--[[user:LA2]]
:Apart from my own logos, I like this one best. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
:This is a pretty one --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
:I like this one too. My vote would be for it right now. --[[user:AstroNomer|AstroNomer]]
:I like it too. -- [[user:The Anome|The Anome]]
:This is really nice. --[[user:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]
:I have sent in some 'favicon.ico' icons of 6/7... [[user:The Anome|The Anome]]

===10===
[[Image:newlogo5.png]] (from [[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]])&lt;br&gt;
'''Comments''': A very good candidate. - [[MMGB]]
:I agree, one of the best.
(NB: not a lot of comments, but this one made it to the &quot;leading&quot; list on the basis of comments made elsewhere) - [[MMGB]]

===18===
[[Image:yy_wiki_ks02.png]]
'''Comments:''' Who did this one - I really like it! The &quot;knowledge shared&quot; is a slightly different approach, but well worth investigating. - [[MMGB]]
:Yeah, another nice design.  We do want people to think that Wikipedia is all about sharing knowledge, too.  But I suspect that if we adopted this precise logo, Wikipedia would soon be called &quot;Wikipedia: Knowledge Shared,&quot; which is a name I don't like.  Whatever words you put on a logo are going to become a sort of trademark for the project, at least, and very possibly part of the name.  So, in a logo, it's important to use &quot;The Free Encyclopedia&quot; or something equally simple (easy to understand) and catchy. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

:This one is good, either with 'Knowledge shared' of 'The free encyclopedia' because the title and the tagline don't compete but reinforce each other. --[[user:Tsja|Tsja]]

:Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but by this singular passion from other animals, which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continued and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure. --Hobbes

&lt;br&gt; 
'''Comments''' - ooh yes, I really like this one. Tasteful, elegant, sophisticated. This has my number one vote for now. One semi-suggestion... could we also try a very pale blue background?- [[MMGB]]

This is really good :-) I don't particularly like the current wikipedia logo (sorry, whoever created it!) but this has made it look tasteful and catchy. This is my favourite too. -- [[sodiumtheperson|sodium]]

I like this one, too. A little larger than the original, but it will do;) I don't think a &quot;pale blue background&quot; would be a good idea, though. A transparent PNG will look better on skins, too! --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

This I don't like. A logo should be simple/clean, this is too cluttered. The text on the globe is legible and when seeing it you try to read it and it is irrelevent.

I think this is the best one. I like it that you can read the text, but maybe it should be something more relevant. Maybe a piece of our text about [[Hegel]] (but that's not much) or some other philosopher? :-) Or the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]? And make it still a bit ''rounder'', that would be cool.&lt;br&gt;
For the German Wikipedia I'd like to have a German text, is that possible? [[user:Kurt Jansson|Kurt Jansson]]

I'm shocked! How can you not like the text - &quot;... which is a love of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continual and indefatigable generation of knowledge...&quot; I think it's absolutely perfect and totally relevant. - [[MMGB]]

Very nice. I especially like the clean and elegant &quot;Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia&quot; text. Some minor issues: the Hobbes text, while certainly not irrelevant, is somewhat distracting. As mentioned above, people will be trying to read it, especially with the very prominant &quot;vehemence of any carnal pleasure&quot; at the bottom. Generally, you want a logo to be understood at a glance; I think a more innocuous text would be better suited to the purpose (something from one of our own articles? [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Encyclopedia Encyclopedia], maybe?). Also, it seems a little big to me; could you post a slightly smaller version? A couple of tweaks and I give this one my top vote. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

Okay, I'll confess: My English is too bad to really understand the text. :-)&lt;br&gt;
But I still think a text out of Wikipedia would be better.  --[[user:Kurt Jansson|Kurt Jansson]]

Yep, I love this one too.  The text seems perfectly appropriate to me.  There are many quotations, but especially a few from Aristotle, Spinoza, or Descartes that I can think of, would be grand.  OK, this is important enough for me to dig up those texts.  Einen moment bitte... --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
:...the more things the mind knows, the better does it understand its own strength and the order of Nature; by increased self-knowledge, it can  direct itself more easily, and lay down rules for its own guidance; and, by increased knowledge of Nature, it can more easily avoid what is useless.
::--Spinoza, ''Tractatus  de Intellectus Emendatione''
OK, so that's all I could find after a quick search of the texts.  The Hobbes quote seems rather more appropriate than this.

Thing is, Hobbes is more credible than Wikipedia, right now.  :-)  A quote from a famous philosopher adds a bit of class.  Moreover, the sentiment expressed, whether or not false (depends on whether you're in a randy mood, I suppose :-) ), is 100% appropriate for Wikipedia's mission.  It's hard to imagine finding a very much more appropriate [http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=epigraph epigraph] for Wikipedia.

The words &quot;carnal pleasure&quot; are very cool, for a variety of reasons.  (1) They presuppose that the reader is sophisticated enough to understand that &quot;carnal pleasure&quot; means more than sex.  That makes it clear to mature, educated adults that Wikipedia is run by mature, educated adults.  This is important, on the Internet.  It also puzzles and excites slightly less mature, slightly less well-educated people, which is a nice effect.  (2) They are slightly titillating, I imagine, to nearly everyone.  A good thing.  (3) They are necessary to convey Hobbes' thought, which is a very noble sentiment we want people to associate with Wikipedia (and which can justly be associated with Wikipedia; why not?).  (4) They're necessary to suggest to people that Wikipedia is better than sex.  Another good thing.

So, we quote a famous philosopher, appeal to people's intelligence, titillate them, give them the idea that Wikipedia is a noble enterprise, and suggest that it is even better than sex.  ''What could be better???'' :-) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Ok, you've convinced me. But I'd still like to see it slightly smaller. --[[STG]]

:Actually, now that I see the smaller one, I like the big one best. :) (Sorry for the trouble, C.) This one gets my vote for best so far. --Stephen Gilbert

This isn't really on the logo topic, but...
A tiny problem with #1 above: it implies that people who are not adults are not mature and educated.  Younger people (like me) are not necessarily &quot;puzzled and excited&quot; by 'carnal pleasure'.  If I'm less educated because of my age, it doesn't mean that I am less mature. (enough of this!)
I like this logo.  Maybe &quot;Wikipedia&quot; could be in blue?  I like the idea that in the other language Wikipedias, the quote (whatever it will be) would be in that language, if possible.  I agree that the quote should not be from Wikipedia, because the article it came from might change, and then the wuote would be obsolete.  -- [[Dreamyshade]]

:Yes, Dreamy's right - she's got a right to feel a bit &quot;dismissed&quot; by the insinuation that to not be an adult implies a lack of maturity. Though hang on, maybe the definition of &quot;adult&quot; is when &quot;you decide to behave like one&quot; - in which case Dreamy '''''is''''' an adult, but alternatively it's purely a matter of age, in which case... (writing suddenly ceased due to gruesome explosion of brain, Film at 11). - [[MMGB]] 

I like this one best, too. I would prefer the entire globe, even if it meant reducing the font size a bit in the word, &quot;Wikipedia.&quot; --[[user:Rose Parks|Rose Parks]]

Yes, i like this one too. One only thing, could we have n.7 above as a &quot;backup logo&quot; for situations were the space available is smaller, and the text would be completely illegible? I can not think of any example right now, but there ''might'' be a situation were 7 was better...[[user:AstroNomer|AstroNomer]]
::I think it would be ok to have illegible text. Its a logo, the text does not really matter though having it a Hobbes quote is cool. Consistancy is more important. I believe we should switch the logos now, as it does not really change it by very much. -[[w:Eean]]

I have also given this one the 'favicon.ico' treatment -- [[user:The Anome|The Anome]]

Okay, babylon.com and my girlfriend helped me figure it out. And '''yes''', I really like it. I'll search for a German translation (where is it from?). --[[user:Kurt Jansson|Kurt Jansson]]

Yep, that's my favourite -- [[user:WojPob|wojpob]]

I like this one a lot; the quote is perfect. I think however that the small version should drop the line &quot;The free encyclopedia.&quot;: it looks to crowded and small. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

----
I've been entirely absent from this discussion, mainly because I wasn't at all impressed by any of the other entries.  But this one I like, a lot.  Consider this a ''big'' vote in favor of this particular logo.  --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

Here's a version of the logo encoded more efficiently and with transparency information (it mamages to squeeze into 4K instead of the original's 15K):

[[sodiumtheperson|sodium]] &lt;br&gt;
[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]&lt;br&gt;
...and others (see above)!

OK, it's looking to me like, overall, #24 is the most popular, with #7 a runner up.  I like #24 best myself!  It contains a very apt epigraph for Wikipedia, maintains a nice continuity with the present logo, and contains &quot;Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia.&quot;

So, let's do it!  I'll ask Jimbo to install #24 as the new logo.

Lee, your version of the logo isn't as bold as the old one...  I'm not sure I like that as well, but I totally agree of course that having a 4K logo would be great! --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Thank you. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

:Yeah, I mistakenly &quot;corrected&quot; the gamma value.  The value now is arguably wrong from the physics-of-light point of view, but it looks better from the actual-browser-display point of view.  I also managed to squeeze a few more bytes out of it (3901 bytes!):

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Whee.  There's a problem here -- the idea being that subpages are perceived by some to be a good thing, and perceived by others to be a bad thing.  This is a very bad thing -- and let me see if I can shed some light on why -I- consider some sort of subpage functionality to be a good idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subpages create a 'namespace' capability -- the ability to create an article with a singular name, and associate several articles with it.  For example, the use of the word [[Canon]] is different in several contexts, from literature to religion to computer science.  If you're looking for a specific meaning of a word, and examples of it, then subpages make sense -- the main entry (say [[Canon]]) could say something approximating the general attributes of something described as canon (say, &quot;the most-defined, most correct form for something&quot;), and then a subpage for Religious, a subpage for Literature, a subpage for Computer Science.  However, the subpage capability as it was implemented was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enough for this function -- because it was too time-consuming and too resource-intensive to build the list of backward links to a given topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subpages also limit the number of &quot;write collisions&quot; on a page, when properly constructed.  When there are two or more people writing on the same document at the same time, it's impossible for their editing agents to talk with each other to figure out how to do so appropriately without losing data.  SOMEONE always ends up the loser.  When this number grows to 25 or 30, only one can win, leaving the remainder out in the cold -- causing even more problems, frustration, and eventually unsubmitted text.  With subpages in place, one person can edit one subpage, another can edit another, and the scope of the write collisions can be minimized -- even though they still exist with subpage existence, they're nowhere near as bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to think that the Wiki system (in any incarnation) is not appropriate for concurrent editing -- but automatic subpage creation could be a GOOD thing, to save text that would otherwise be lost in the ether.  But that would require subpages to still exist -- and to do things behind the scenes to cause the main article to link to them, else their existence might get lost until someone decides to play &quot;clean-up&quot; and go to the &quot;orphans&quot; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And for those who dislike them as subpages, call them &quot;nodes&quot;, like the Everything system at http://www.everydevel.com/ does -- set it up so that any new submission generates a new node, and then edit it into the main document.  Or, if you want to have multiple 'sections' of an article, create subpages/nodes for each section, and then pull their information into a single view -- each section independently editable by people who are knowledgeable about that section.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of subpages in their current form, in my opinion, is not a bad thing.  However, SOME form of subpage functionality is going to be necessary to scale the database in a structured, consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Philosophy}}
''This is not an official policy page (yet). Rather, this is a community-editable page in an attempt to define what we consider to be vandalism.  Feel free to edit the text so that it reflects your understanding of the community attitude toward vandalism.''&lt;br&gt;
''This page is not an all-language policy page. It only reflects an English point of view''.

''See also: [[w:Wikipedia:Dealing with vandalism]]''

====I know it when I see it====
Does it really need to be defined? 

It's arguable that most (identified) vandalism has consisted of really quite ''obvious'' cases.  Hence, Wikipedia doesn't need to define an &quot;official&quot; policy on what constitutes [[en:Vandalism|vandalism]] at all.  We can use the rule of thumb, &quot;When a reasonable person might be in doubt as to whether something is vandalism, it would be polite not to call it vandalism.&quot;

Of course, that depends on the normative definitions of &quot;obvious&quot;, &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;polite&quot;, which are necessarily subjective.

'''Patent vandalism''' is vandalism where both the reader, and the contributor (of the suspected vandalism), agree that it is vandalism.  This is sometimes easy to determine (e.g. vandal puts HAHAHAHAHA as their edit summary or otherwise states that it is vandalism), and sometimes slightly harder.

====What may be considered Wikipedia vandalism====
Since we wish to encourage people to feel as free as possible in modifying pages (see especially [[en:editing policy]] and [[en:wikipedia:Be_bold_in_updating_pages|be bold in updating pages]]), as a community we should, at least in most cases, be opposed to the labeling of any but the most obvious examples of vandalism as indeed &quot;vandalism.&quot; 

For instance, when someone adds a line to an article adding an insult or profanity, that may be considered vandalism and should not stand.  There have been instances where entire pages have been deleted without explanation, or replaced with something that can best be described as infantile, and not anything that anyone would confuse with an encyclopedia article. That too can be considered vandalism.

By contrast with the foregoing, often merely [[en:Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense|bad jokes and other &quot;nonsense&quot;]] can be called vandalism, but ''sometimes they shouldn't be''; usually they are simply cases of misunderstanding, confusion, or humor unnecessary to the entry.  Such stuff should be removed, but there's little point in justifying its removal by labeling it &quot;vandalism.&quot;

The most inviting target for such vandalism is the [[en:Main Page]]. Its contents have been replaced dozens of times by anonymous people with off-topic material, which is why editing of the page is currently restricted to Wikipedians with administrator access.

Other types of edits considered vandalism at some point: 
*Using an offensive user name: Jimbo Wales decided that [[en:User:Throbbing Monster Cock|TMC's chosen username]] was vandalism, a summary of that controversy should be included in this article. -- [[user:Netesq|NetEsq]]
*Blanking own talk page ([[en:User:BuddhaInside]])
*Blanking or putting insanities on other people's user page ([[en:User:RK]])

====Vandalism through anonymous websites====
Vandalism may occur through websites from which the user can use an anonymous IP address. After their IP address has been blocked, vandals may attack Wikipedia through these websites. Examples are:
*http://64.203.129.86 - Web Warper
*http://66.36.249.149 - @Anonymize

==Legal action against vandals==
''Moved from [[en:Wikipedia:Village pump]] on [[Saturday]], [[August 2]]nd, 0[[2003]].''

When certain users repeatedly (I'm talking about the really really bad ones) vandalize Wikipedia, why doesn't Wikipedia seek to press criminal charges or
file a civil lawsuit?  Vandalism is a crime.

:The whole point about Wikiweb is that everyone can format the content of the pages. This will necessarily, by knowing how some (or a lot of) people behave, also have its negative consequences. If Wikipedia would press criminal charges ''here and there'', this would discourage the signup of new users such as myself. Vandalism is a crime, but when you leave your [[Lambhorgini Diablo]] unlocked in the streets it will be vandalized. The regular users of Wikipedia, should then see their responsibility in fixing things up. And they / you / we do. In the Norwegian wikipedia, however, I've found alot of articles that really upsets me, but this doesn't allow the management to file charges according to the wikiweb manifesto. That's my opinion..

== Trolling below the radar ==

Take a look at [[Special:Contributions/66.157.94.151]] some seem legitimate, but some seem suspicious, but I cannot confirm as inaccurate. I reverted the Michael Jackson one which seem an outright troll. This seems to be the biggest danger to the Wikipedia. This kind of vandalism can go unnoticed, because it is not possible to tell at first sight whether something is accurate or not if it is written in a certain manner. Have you guys run across the more sophisticated vandals? [[User:Dori|Dori]] 17:25, Nov 20, 2003 (UTC)

: On a second though, after JeLuF's investigations, it seems that this user's edits may be legitimate, but the points about under the radar trolls remains. [[User:Dori|Dori]] 17:30, Nov 20, 2003 (UTC)

: A quick look at [[Special:Contributions/66.157.94.151]] makes it clear that this user is [[Easter Bradford]] or an EasterBradford sock-puppet or supporter, so misuse of Wikipedia is no surprise.

:I see no clearly-defined dividing line between trolling and POV. At one end there is deliberate vandalism and at the other there are contributions with perhaps just a very slight bias. Somewhere in the middle is the grey area where most discussion page arguments take place. 

:The most subtle problem is an article or section that contains nothing but a few negative statements on a subject. Such statements may be obscure but verifiable facts, but on their own can give an article a complete bias. 

:A recent example is an addition on &quot;Saudi Culture&quot; which said only that Saudi Arabia banned the burial of non-Moslems (untrue)and the practice of other religions (partly true - non-Islamic religious ceremonies are only permitted in private). Even if true, this is hardly a sound representation of &quot;Saudi Culture&quot; and not of much use to a schoolchild doing a project on the subject. What about camels, tents, songs, stories, carpets, desert-life, legends, musical instruments and so forth?

== vandal == leftist in wikipedia speak ==

I edited the Haymarket Riot page ONE TIME to correct the basic information and add new information, and my edits were deleted and called vandalism. Turns out that wikipedia is infested with fauxLibertarians who hate it when leftists add in facts that disagree with their world view.

== vandal == information about vandalism used as pretext for censorship by administrators ==

It is interesting to note that this text regarding administrators who use vandalism as a pretext for censorship:

&quot;Many localized Wikipedia versions seem to have administrators who claim &quot;vandalism&quot;, remove the edit, block the user/IP and just to make sure remove the edit from the pages &quot;history&quot; page when factual objective information backed up by science and numerous references are added in cases where they know the truth and want to hide it. There are many examples of this; and you will be able to verify this approach to what is &quot;vandalism&quot; by adding such serious factual information yourself. These cases are edit disagreement where civilized debate on the discussion pages would reveal the information these administrators try to hide which is probably the reason such information is claimed &quot;vandalism&quot;. Honest Wikipedia administrators really should keep an eye on what administrators call &quot;vandalism&quot;; a disagreement or dispute over a fact is not automatically vandalism if one party is a Wikipedia administrator, and blocking under the pretext of &quot;vandalism&quot; is not a good way to avoid debate.&quot; in [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_vandalism&amp;diff=446454&amp;oldid=446452 this edit] was removed by Wikipedia administrator [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shanel Shanel] without any reason given.

== Where to report vandalism on meta? ==

The article page does not reveal where I report vandalism on meta itself. &quot;[[w:Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress|Vandalism in progress]]&quot; leads to a page on en.

==&quot;Vandalism&quot; not to be applied to ''good faith'' text==
Some materialists are foolishly going to hell and think that vandalism can have something in common with good-faith articles. So that is something to be considered well. My suggestion is still that new editions/additions to be moved to talk page first instead of marking it immediately as vandalism... At least few people have to see that addition - discuss it... It is not done just in few minutes and &quot;vandal&quot; is detected, no... Idea is that wikipedia must make those '''[edit]''' links on every page to be somehow hidden and/or not shown immediately... I mean it is better to print out text immediately not clicking on &quot;print version&quot;... Is there difference? Those '''[edit]''' links. So one must better see printable version, and if he wants - he is welcome to add something - go to that edit mode - just one click away... Many people read wiki, but do not like those '''[edit]''' links... So I think discussion page might be merged with that original page with edit links... And printable version must be first to see on website... Especially on mobiles phones netbooks etc...

== Insanities? ==

There is a sentence in the article that doesn't make sense: &quot;Blanking or putting insanities on other people's user page&quot;

I don't have permission to edit but would someone who does please correct this? I am guessing the author meant &quot;profanities&quot;. [[User:Bcaulf|Bcaulf]] 04:59, 20 June 2011 (UTC)

Hello, 

My name is papotages and I've been working on fr.wikipedia.org. Being a member of the raëlian movement, I was constantly censored, not due to the lack of documentation, but because nobody could play the counterpart role. So, my arguments have been anoying to the community. I have been censored from the very begining. As you may know, in France, people are being disinformed, so the majority felt ok to censore me. The situation of cults in France is comparable to what it could be in totalitarian states.

Thank you for your help.

Liberty is threatened.

Pap'otages

:Since the subject here is vandalism, rather than censorship, the above could be interpreted as vandalism but a kinder interpretation would be that its placement here is an error.  Repeated placements after correction or removal would rise to the level of wasting other people's time and thus vandalism. [[User:12.45.50.136|12.45.50.136]] 04:24, 18 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:: Vandalism and censorship are in many cases, but should not be, the very same thing. This is specially common in local Wikipedia projects like French version highlighted here. If you can not agrument civilized or provide links or in any other way counter the information then it is very easy to just claim &quot;vandalism&quot;, censor the information and block the user who added it. Censorship and vandalism claims seem to go hand in hand, but, in my humble opinion, should not. Pap'otages comment is very relevant.

:::Gentle interpretation is that Papotages was seeking help, by whatever means he could imagine. I did not know of this message. Papotages was ip blocked the day after (or the very same day) he was writing that, and discussion for name blocking him was well under way. Actually, he would have been name blocked if it had been possible at that point to sysops. Vandalism and censorship were badly confused in his case, as it is much simpler to pretend dealing with vandalism than to face one's own censorship tendencies.
:::I came back from holidays 2 days after that message, and played the counterpart.
:::See the fascinating collection of point of view on the topic [[La neutralité de point de vue]] and his list of [[Censure|live examples of censorship]] as applied on the french wikipedia

:Papotages is an interesting case of vandalism, so it seems quite on-topic here. In case anyone's wondering, he operates by opening about 15 windows of [[Special:Randompage]]. He then clicks edit in each one, pastes a pre-prepared body text and edit summary, takes a deep breath, then saves them all within the space of 30 seconds. Then he hangs up his modem, redials, and starts again. This should be dealt with in the same way as a [[vandalbot]], that is by hiding the edits from RC. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]]

29 November: Good idea: Have policy pages as part of [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Militia Wikipedia].

Bad idea: Fear-based, military-analogy policies: &quot;it's possible that the average newbie in this generation of contributors would be of the way-too-clueless variety, and that a significant minority would be downright malicious...&quot; &quot;It could be a major disaster.&quot; Save the fear-mongering for the federal government with respect to acts of terrorism, not a openly editable website. We don't need the Wikipedia equivalent of the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act USA PATRIOT Act]. LMS needs to stop watching so much CNN. (Seriously, though, if you're in charge of a collaborative, volunteer project, and you start getting a bunker mentality, a red flag should be going up.) 

:''Really, really'' bad idea, nay, a breathtakingly idiotic idea: constantly shooting yourself in the foot by constantly using inflammatory language, such as &quot;fear-based,&quot; above, instead of trying to engage people with whom you disagree in polite, reasoned dialogue.  The Wikipedia Militia notion isn't ''fear-based.''  If you think it is, you just don't get it.  I'm not engaging in ''fear-mongering.''  I'm trying, in what was '''intended to be''' a lighthearted way (until you came along and spun it in a way that made me look as bad as possible), to get people turned on to the idea of ''doing a whole lot of work'' whenever the time comes to make sure that a huge crop of misguided new people do not ruin Wikipedia--as they could.  Most people who arrive &quot;get it.&quot;  There is always a minority who don't, and they need teaching and dissuading from doing really damaging edits.

:The above sort of comment, Cunctator, borders on libel (because not only is it false, it's outrageously false and completely insulting, and seems designed to damage my reputation).  This frankly outrages me and wastes me time.  I maintain that I am a very reasonable person.  If you reasonably raise a point, I will reasonably respond.  If you accuse me of &quot;fear mongering&quot; and &quot;a bunker mentality&quot; such that &quot;a red flag should be going up,&quot; as you are ''constantly doing,'' then you cannot expect me to take you seriously.  So '''stop it,''' already.  Treat me nicely, and I will treat you nicely. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

12 November: too bad. I would have very much liked to build the entry on the plane crash. Oh well.

----
:Well build it! You know you're the best we have at that sort of stuff. I don't know why you are having so much trouble coping with the thought that there is a place for the encyclopedia, and a separate place for discussions &quot;about&quot; the encyclopedia, and anything else you want to talk about.  I view it more as an exercise in neatness and tidiness, rather than an attempt to inhibit discussion. After all, when you buy Britannica, you don't get all the inter-office memos that obviously went into its creation. In my own view *everything* that is not an encyclopedia article would *not* be in the 'pedia, including all the talk entries. However this is not about restrictions, this is about distinguishing the &quot;encyclopedia&quot; from the &quot;discussion about the encyclopedia&quot;.

:Anyway, I'm really saddened to see you taking it this way. As someone who has also dealt with the &quot;should I stay or should I go&quot; issue, I do hope you reconsider, because regardless of your disputes with Larry, everyone (including LMS) sees you as a vital and passionate contributor to the project. - [[MMGB]]

:I agree 100% with the above. - [[Seb]]
----
Oh, I haven't stopped contributing simply because of the &quot;meta&quot; move, even though I basically disagree with all of your arguments; note the use of &quot;when you buy Britannica&quot;--Wikipedia had been built on the exact opposite philosophy of a purchasable, fixed object. Framing what LMS has done to me as &quot;disputes with Larry&quot; is rather misleading, as he is in the paid employ of the project and self-appointed &quot;dictator-for-life&quot; and I'm just someone who decided to volunteer some time and effort. He can make sweeping decisions about the Wikipedia project and censor and punish dissent; I can't. LMS has told me that he doesn't consider me a vital and passionate contributor to the project, but a troll whose input on Wikipedia policy is not welcome. 
----
:Well, many people here do consider you a vital and passionate contributor to the project. -AxelBoldt
----
I genuinely and deeply appreciate your support, but unless substantive changes are made, I will no longer contribute to the project in any significant way. You really should start using the past tense.

I'll continue to point out bugs in the PHP Script, because I respect Magnus's effort, as a contributory way of saying that blindly embracing it is foolhardy. But its nature only reflects the overall nature of Wikipedia; I can't blame the Script for that.

By the way, is anyone storing tarballs?
----
:I have said many times and in many ways that you've done excellent work for us.  I dare not say more.  I don't want to get into another exchange of characterizations. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
Thank you. I do wish you had stuck to that. I assume you just believe that I somehow transformed from someone doing excellent work to someone doing horrible, destructive things, which would mean I must be insane, retarded, delusional, or malicious. I'm simply arguing that I'm not, and that maybe the work that you have found to be destructive would have been as beneficial to Wikipedia as my work on, e.g. 9/11. Oh well.
----
* M*****s &quot;I'm not a drop-out - maybe a kick-out ;-P&quot; For the record, M*****s doesn't want to be listed on this [[Wikipedia drop-outs]] page.

I'm still active on wikipedia, allthough not as blatantly as in the beginning (I would be trolled by LMS); I just do what I like, within the reality as it is censored by LMS

So, I'm NOT a drop-out! I might have been one, perhaps I should have been one, but I'm not. Got it? -- Mathijs

LMS doesn't take criticism well, does he?
----
3 december: Support&lt;br&gt;Cunctator, please do not give up what you are doing for Wikipedia.&lt;BR&gt;
It's just too bad that people want to see your arguments as personal aggression and trolling; these people are looking for the easy way out -- [[Mathijs]]

:I think I take reasonable, polite criticism very well, and I take quite a bit of not-particularly-polite-and-rather-blunt criticism pretty well, too.  What I don't take well are unfair attacks, such as the words &quot;LMS doesn't take criticism well, does he?&quot;

:You've both been very trollish, upon occasion, in the past.  But I do not dismiss either of you as ''nothing more than'' trolls.  I just think that the overall pattern of ''some of'' your behavior has been, well, very much like that of the many trolls we have surely come across in our rambles about the Internet. --[[LMS]]

::here it goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that YOU YOURSELF are the troll. You are very rude. You are trying to make committed, truthfull people into trolls, abusing them, making everything personal. Please look into the mirror, Larry! I won't take anymore trolling from you, mister Sanger. -- [[Mathijs]]

I've deleted the list you've added to your page, C.  My considered opinion is that it is a bad idea that we maintain a publicly-viewable list of page titles that have been deleted.  There is no good reason to do this--if you think there is one, I would appreciate that you spell it out explicitly--and an excellent reason not to do it, namely, it might very well encourage vandals.  The only reason I can imagine for keeping such a list is that you do not trust my fairness in deleting titles--which isn't a very good reason. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

At the risk of jumping in on a tedious and lame &quot;discussion&quot;, I don't trust ''my'' fairness in deleting titles, so instead I wrote a patch to UseModWiki that uses soft security. cf. http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiPatches/PageDeletion . The fact that you are being constantly irritated by a user complaining about your so-called abuse of your power is unsurprising, and why there are no administrator functions that actual have any necessary purpose in the UseModWiki software. In the case of deleted pages, see http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?OpenProcess . The idea is that a good admin does no administrating. -- SunirShah

----
My considered opinion is that it shouldn't be for you to judge whether or not that's a very good reason, even if that ''were'' the only reason. 

Let's say for argument's sake that I put up such a list just to put a check on potential mistaken deletions. Such mistaken deletions could be because of unfair deletion, but they could also be simple errors of judgment or misunderstanding or confusion. For example, the &quot;Stevie Wonder is God&quot; entry, which was deleted, was not a joke article at all, but a pretty useful example of fallacious reasoning, and was linked to as such from other entries.

There are, however, other reasons for maintaining a list, one of which is just that it's interesting information. A more functional reason is that such a list lets one see immediately what type of pages do merit deletion, which would let everyone know pretty quickly by comparison whether an entry which seems questionable to them would in fact merit deletion.

And on and on.

----
Well, it is, in fact, for me to judge.  And I do so judge!  That's enough for now, C.  Leave the issue alone. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
Can't refute that eloguent counter-argument! That's enough for now, L. Other than deleting such vandal-inciting lists, leave my userpage alone. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
Oh, and wasn't that a brilliant reply.  This is all just a game for you, isn't it?  It sure seems to be.  Isn't it obvious that I'm tired of arguing with you, and that I refuse to be drawn into it?

I'm afraid I ''do'' reserve the right to edit your userpage.

And I just noticed the &quot;wow, you are a jerk&quot; comment.  Can you not begin to see the irony in that comment? --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
Look, C., we have an ongoing personality conflict.  Let's just reduce our interaction to as ''little'' as we possibly can.  This will benefit the project as a whole. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
LMS: I wish we could all get along. I really think you should try talking about the issues, and trying to work things out, rather than refusing to talk about it.

The first step towards resolving interpersonal disputes is willingness to admit that you are wrong. Very rarely if ever does a dispute happen which is solely the fault of one party. For example, I'm willing to admit that the creation of a vandalism archive was a bit silly, maybe even semi-trollish. The amount of controversy it caused and the time that controversy took up certaintly wasn't worth the thing the controversy was over. So, I am willing to admit I have some responsibility for what conflicts have occured. I would hope that the other players involved are mature enough to do the same.

However, if you really feel that the time and effort of trying is not worth the chance of results, or whatever, may I suggest a way that in the future, you can avoid interaction with TheCunctator such as these? How about if, next time TheCunctator does something that you disagree with, either (a) leave it alone and ignore it, or (b) find someone else to deal with the situation instead of you? That way, maybe you can avoid any further interactions with TheCunctator, like the one you have had here. -- [[user:SJK_|SJK_]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical|2002}}(Disclaimer: By the below I do not mean to attack Larry Sanger personally; I'm just commenting on what he has said.)

On Larry's [[w:Larry Sanger|personal page]], he writes (he added this in revision 234, of October 16):
:I co-founded Wikipedia, and I am one of a few people who are paid  (by Jimbo Wales / Bomis) to help organize this project. I like to think of myself as another soldier, not a general. But I know that this is a simplification of the situation. I have self-consciously rejected, in the Wikipedia project, the title of &quot;editor-in-chief,&quot; which is my title in the Nupedia project. I am quite aware that, in order to win as many good people to this project as possible, it is important that I do not try to control  people here; it is important, moreover, that people do not feel controlled by me, even if I'm not trying, because they'll resent this just as much. I strongly feel that Wikipedia thrives precisely because it is open and free, and how open and free the project is, is in part a straightforward function of my attitude toward it.

Compare that to what he has recently said in [[w:Larry_Sanger/Is_Wikipedia_an_experiment_in_anarchy|one of his columns]] (Nov 1):
:I need to be granted fairly broad authority by the community--by you, dear reader--if I am going to do my job effectively. Until fairly recently, I was granted such authority by Wikipedians. I was indeed not infrequently called to justify decisions I made, but not constantly and nearly always respectfully and helpfully. This place in the community did not make me an all-powerful editor who must be obeyed on pain of ousting; but it did make me a leader. That's what I want, again. This is my job. 

Similarly, he says ([[w:Larry Sanger/Is Wikipedia an experiment in anarchy Talk|see here]]) :
:But when push comes to shove, if a decision must be made and there's a serious controversy, and I'm partaking of it, sorry, but I'm going to get my way. And you'll be expected to hold your tongue after that.

Am I the only person who detects a change in LMS' view of his own position? Am I the only person who fears this is a change for the worse?

Simon James Kissane, Nov 1.

Petty tyrants are not the issue here. Larry is fair and answers email when he has time. He gets dragged into contributors' petty squabbles. ~BF

&lt;i&gt;&quot;My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards&lt;br&gt;
False gods, I scuff&lt;br&gt;
At pettiness which plays so rough&lt;br&gt;
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs&lt;br&gt;
Kick my legs to crash it off&lt;br&gt;
Say okay, I have had enough&lt;br&gt;
What else can you show me?&quot;&lt;br&gt; ~[[w:Bob Dylan]]&lt;/i&gt;

:Yes, Larry's position has changed.  No, I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing.  I suspect Larry and Jimbo (who own the server and thus control the project's destiny in many ways, ultimately) have decided that arguments that don't end when LMS puts his foot down like they used to are interfering with where they want the project to go.  After seeing some of the nonsense of the past few weeks, I tend to agree with that sentiment, and I largely trust their vision for the project (with the proviso that I'm not entirely convinced that the way they interpret/implement the GFDL here makes a fork practical if it ever came to that - I'd like some more clarity there). --[[w:Robert Merkel]]

:I agree with you, Simon. Larry's vision of his role has changed. The way I understand it, he does what he thinks is best for the health of the encyclopedia. Usually this means that agreement should be reached through discussion; however he has less and less time on his hands and the community is growing. This scale problem means that discussions threaten to slow down the project, insofar as article production is reduced. On the other hand, one has to recognize that discussions (especially public ones) about Wikipedia help refine our definition of the project. So Larry is in a quite difficult position, I think. In cases where disagreement is not resolved, he has to '''judge''' which discussions do and which do not promise to help the project. There's a slew of interplaying factors here. Some contributors believe that more freedom can only help the project. Some others think that more freedom can hurt the project because people will spend time and energy visiting and contributing content that is not encyclopedic. Some (I am inclined to believe most) contributors can change their minds concerning this issue through dialogue. Others (I am inclined to believe few) cannot. I think most of us want as few as possible to leave ship. Perhaps establishing a parallel wiki which provides more freedom to wikipedians would help keep the site &quot;clean&quot;. But I believe unity should be a definite goal to strive for here, and we need to clearly articulate what the means of attaining that are. --[[w:Seb]]

I think it's a little sad that he feels he has to regulate the direction of Wikipedia so strongly; I'd rather he spent more time encouraging what he felt was the correct direction, than discouraging what he felt was the wrong direction. At the moment the technology and his goals are somewhat in conflict--and if neither changed, over time, the technology would win, but the technology can and will be changed (a concrete example is the open-ended blocking of the homepage), and will, over time, come to more strongly reflect and enforce his views.

I only think this is a little sad because it means that he can't fully harness the energy of volunteers. What's so great about the Wikipedia system is that it doesn't have to resort to censorship to moderate idiosyncracy (see how the [[New Age]] page has developed, though it at the time needs some re-editing); but that's what Larry feels he has to resort to now. And once the gate is opened, he (and thus others) will continue to do so. Unless he says that he is the only one with that power; that others shouldn't use their judgment to delete information, only himself.

It's better to have one dictator than a dictator plus shock troops.

Wikipedia '''does''' need some discipline in general.  If I had just stumbled on this site in the last week, rather than a few months ago, I would have thought Usenet had forked and wikipedia was the result.  What's all this squabbling about?  What's all the debate?  Wikipedia is not your home, though you may have a page on it; it's not your property; outsiders do not have any God-given right to come in and put of pictures of penes and Grimace and gorillas and have their tripe recorded for posterity.  All this squabble is missing the point in a big way: yes, it's important to work out community norms in a community-controlled project, but to outsiders you look like a sandbox full of 4th-graders.  Do it on the list-serv; put all meta-pages in a separate namespace; and by default have only '''articles''' show up in the Recent Changes.

: ''I agree entirely.  Thats what I'd have said if I was (a) eloquent (b) not to busy modifying actual articles.  Oh, and [[w:Gareth_Owen/How_to_destroy_Wikipedia]], obviously'' -- [[w:GWO]]

By the way, I think it's time we moved pages like this to [http://meta.wikipedia.com]. --[[w:LMS]]

As I said on [[Wikipedia utilities/Personal subpages to be deleted]], I'm happy to see this page get deleted unless anyone else who has commented here really minds. Its not that I've changed my mind about whats said herein, its just that I've come to agree with Larry's view that this sort of nazelgazing is really a distraction from what we are supposed to be doing, and is just going to produce useless friction between people. -- [[w:SJK]]

Aha!  I just haven't gotten around to deleting those. --[[w:LMS]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical|category=[[Category:Archived discussions]]}}
So, one recent issue we've had in Wikipedia is of a user with an axe to grind. He comes to Wikipedia, and attempts to begin writing NPOV articles about a topic which has been argued about for the past 150 years, generating numerous books and articles, and extensive discussion in every book on the history and philosophy of science. A topic about which he holds a particular view, and since he hasn't bothered to read much about the other side, a topic about which he doesn't understand the other side's arguments.

What's the right approach? I don't think we should encourage people to learn through editing articles on Wikipedia and constantly getting corrected. While it's cute and fun for the axe grinder, it's mostly annoying to everyone else.

----

Do you want to give the specifics? 

There is a class of people who will always be tempted by the (mistaken) notion that the 'pedia presents them with an opportunity to paint their version as the &quot;truth&quot;. I think all of us have been guilty of that at some point, to at least a minor extent.

As some general comments - the 'pedia has dealt with many contentious issues, and will continue to deal with many more. We all say that &quot;all newcomers are welcome&quot; and that we are &quot;non-exclusive&quot; in our approach, and for the most part this is true. However, people will turn up and take a topic like &quot;abortion&quot;, &quot;new age&quot;, &quot;creationism vs science' or whatever, and feel that because the article does not present their viewpoint as the &quot;truth&quot; they will attempt to change it. If a complete newbie picks a REALLY sensitive topic to make drastic edits to, they might feel beaten into the ground by the people who have already been through 10 kms of text debate and who could be a bit &quot;curt&quot; in their attitude towards the ressurrection of &quot;old issues&quot;.

One real advantage of the meta environment is that we could (and should!) use it as an archive of the pages of debate these topics generate. Newbies could be directed towards the lengthy debates that have already happened, which will either make them better informed, of sufficiently daunt them from going down that road (and yet still retain enthusiasm for the overall project).

If someone has really got an axe to grind, then the best approach is to pose them a list of questions in a talk page, and ask for their refutations. If they are sufficiently &quot;clued in&quot; about the concept of [[NPOV]] they will get with the program and fall into line, and think about their answers.

Other options involve going to Wikipedia-L and looking for collective support of your viewpoint against the other. The 'pedia is a collaborative project and you will usually find someone who is interested enough to add some weight to the debate. 

As for Wikipetiquette - remember you are attacking a &quot;viewpoint&quot; and not the &quot;presenter of the viewpoint&quot;. I have had some outrageous disputes with LDC on some topics, but that has no bearing on my high assessment of him as a person and intellect. 

The final alternative is just summary deletions of their modifications. Obviously this is a last resort, but justified if the newcomer simply refuses to collaborate. I have no desire to see someone discouraged from further participation in the project, but the integrity of the 'pedia must always come first. - [[MMGB]]

I know the specific case you're refering to, Greg, but I think you're being a little harsh. The contributions are being made in good faith, and there are various people working with the contributor to achieve NPOV. Work like that is slow-going and sometimes frustrating; usually if something like that is taxing my patience, I just take a step back and recuit a few people to keep an eye on things.

:Good faith isn't good enough. He simply doesn't seem interested in reading the literature, and I assure you that it's very inefficient to teach him by constantly editing articles. If we aren't a community, it's much less efficient to reach consensus. GregLindahl

As for learning through writing articles, I think it definitely should be encouraged... within certain guidelines. It's a great way to learn about a topic, but only if you're willing to do some research. If a person knows almost nothing about a topic, he should research first, write articles second. --Stephen Gilbert

----
I dunno -- I can think of a lot of axe grinders -- currently we may be building up to a re-match of the Polish-Prussian front.  I'm personally very concerned that we've got more than a few people out there who think that linking to any distantly connected web site makes an article better.  That, and information that may well be copyrighted is being taken from other web sites (and I don't mean looking at three fairly good sites on a topic, combining, cribbing, and paraphrasing).  Examples are passages of works and/or their translations that could not have been done by the wiki author.  

Don't mean to come off as a gyno-canine, but I really think that, if there is to be a Wiki guard, we should come up with some more clear-cut guidelines for writing NPOV, supportable articles.  And yes, I'm still working on a primary/secondary source article to add to historiography.  I'm just getting tired of people getting accused of unfair acts of deletion (he deleted because he didn't agree), when sometimes things are deleted because the methodology for writing is just WRONG.  Unfortunately, in order to demonstrate that there are certain basic rules to writing an article (transitions, chronological or geographic context, information having to do with the stated topic, and complete sentences are favourite), I think we'll have to come up with more specific guidelines than presently exist.  [[JHK]]
----
Gosh, I hope you're all not talking about me (blush). I meant no harm, and I think I've improved somewhat.

For instance, I am now more likely to &lt;i&gt;propose&lt;/i&gt; a change in the /Talk section, rather than unilaterally change text.

I admit that I came off a bit abrasive at first, and I apologize, Greg, for teasing you.

I've finally come to the view that old hands like LDC, Greg, et al., understand the Wiki nature and the goal of this encyclopedia project better than I do, in many respects. So I've begun to be more careful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{essay}}
This is a proposal that Wikipedia policy should follow the spirit of [[w:ahimsa|ahimsa]], or 'ahinsa', rather than that of violence. 

==Rules==

===When in doubt, don't delete===
: That is, edit ''towards'' a goal, not ''away'' from what you think is bad. If someone contributes something which you find unclear or misleading,  polish their work to make it shine. This polishing may involve deletion, but that shouldn't be considered the intent of the edit.

===When in doubt, don't ascribe bad motives to people===
: Don't say that stuff you don't like is &quot;vandalism&quot; or &quot;diatribe&quot; or &quot;screed&quot;. Rather, treat everyone as if you believe everyone is trying to make a contribution, and is ''in fact'' contributing, even if the contribution isn't clear. [[en:Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith|Assume Good Faith]] — see [[en:Hanlon's Razor|Hanlon's Law]]

===Remember that [[en:NPOV|NPOV]] (neutral point of view) is a collective goal, not individually achievable===
: Don't call stuff that you do &quot;NPOV&quot;, if you can help it. ''Everyone'' is trying to make the articles more &quot;NPOV&quot;, so saying that's what you're doing is a way of implying that others aren't. Rather, indicate where your concern or confusion lies.

==Adherence to ahimsa==
The following refers to the Main conception of ahimsa, which is the most comprehensive.

Adherence to ahimsa is tripartite: neither do injury oneself, get injury done by others, or approve injury done by others.

That makes sense, doesn't it?

Let's look at this again:
# Do not do injury yourself&lt;br&gt;This should be self-evident.
# Do not get others to do injury&lt;br&gt;If you get someone else to do your dirty work, you are still to blame.
# Do not approve of injury done by others&lt;br&gt;If someone commits himsa (injury), don't approve of it--even if you think the results would be nice, don't condone the act of injury to achieve those results.&lt;!-- see [[Talk:WikipediAhimsa#&quot;even if you approve of the results&quot; is confusing]] --&gt;

Many people limit their responsibility to the first, but we need to commit to trying to adhere to all aspects of ahimsa.

Adherence to ahimsa is both proactive and reactive, entailing prevention of and response to injury done by oneself and others.

===According to capacity===
Observance of ahimsa is to be constantly followed by each person according to capacity.

Only saints are expected to be saints.

==Unavoidable himsa==
Commiting himsa is a sin; in the physical world, some himsa is unavoidable for the propagation and health of society. 

Nonascetics are permitted occupational, domestic, and protective (''udyami'', ''graharambhi'', and ''virodhi'') himsa, though avoidance as far as possible is encouraged. Intentional injury (''samkalpi himsa'') is forbidden. 
* Occupational injury is committed, for example, by the writer in upsetting a reader, and the agriculturalist in the weeding of plants--slash-and-burn agriculture is great himsa; Wikipedia weeding could be himsa if done improperly. 
* Some domestic injury is unavoidably committed in the performance of necessary duties, such as keeping things clean, building a house, etc. 
* Protective or defensive himsa is unavoidably commited in the protection of oneself or property--this is the one that can lead to most incorrectly justified himsa.

Is there any unavoidable injury in cyberspace? Certainly to a lesser degree than in the physical world. There's basically no physical property to protect; no physical harm can be done to others. Only thoughts and time can be affected.

===Wikipedia as household?===
The world may be separated between householders (property owners) and ascetics. Ascetics are capable of the total conduct of ahimsa (''sakala charitra''); the responsibilities of the householder permit only partial conduct of ahimsa (''vikala charitra''). Himsa committed within the upkeep and protection of the household is permissible, though discouraged if possible (and should be atoned for).

May Wikipedia be better considered as the natural world, which nobody owns, in which the ascetic lives and thus ''sakala charitra'' is possible, or a household, permitting only vikala charitra?

As Wikipedia is licensed under the [[w:Creative Commons]], the content of Wikipedia is essentially a permanent natural resource, one which cannot be locked away.

But it certainly can be (and has been) argued that just about everything else about Wikipedia, from style to quality to comfort of editing, is like damageable property under the auspices of the Wikipedia &quot;householders&quot;, and needs to be protected, violently if necessary.

The goal of ''sakala charitra'' means that each of those arguments should be handled separately, and wherever possible, a way should be found to remove the need for himsa in the form of upkeep and in the form of protection.

Many times it may be found that arguments that injury is unavoidable are founded upon false attachment (see below).

==Goals of Wikipedia==
The goal of Wikipedia may be recognized in the second vow of Jainism, ''satya'', truth (or the abstension from falsehood).

More specifically, the goal of Wikipedia may be recognized in the dharma of  ''uttama arjava'', ''uttama satya'', and ''uttama akinchana'': supreme honesty, supreme truth, and supreme objectivity (or non-attachment, neutrality), and the tenet of ''anekantavada'', that a thing may be considered from many points of view (note the similarities to the idea of NPOV).

This point was similarly made by the Biblically influenced Larry Wall, founder of Perl, who identified diligence, patience and humility as the virtues of community, and laziness, impatience, and hubris as the virtues of the passionate individual--and said it all depends on perspective: &quot;you can do them all at the same time.&quot;

==Satya==
As ''asatya'' (speaking falsehood) is considered himsa, adherence to satya is part of adherence to ahimsa.

The Jain conception of satya could be used as a justification of censorship or suppression of disagreement, since ''apriya'', or disagreeable speech, is considered asatya. However, this must be balanced against the dharma of honesty and non-attachment--in other words, it is essential to speak one's mind and to not take things personally. If someone is made uneasy by the speech of someone else, that ahimsa is as much the listener's responsibility as the speaker's--for with true renunciation of injury, attachment (pride), and falsehood, it is impossible to be made uneasy.

Rather, understand that criticism, if well-meant, should always be encouraged and that the scorning of others is much more harmful than criticism or objection can be. Adherence to Anekantavada (literally Non-one-endedness or Nonsingular Conclusivity) means owning up to the natural limitations of one’s own ability to grasp the full truth and understanding that more than one perspective and more than one conclusion is needed to get closer to the full picture of reality.

==False attachment==
To achieve a non-violent community one must root out the source of violence, which is ultimately false attachment. False attachment causes fear, which leads to violence. False attachment involves the clinging to wealth and power, which is expressed in society by the centralization of authority and concentration of wealth. Much Wikipedia violence is based on the fear of Wikipedia violence. Much of that fear is based on false attachment. While it is a reality of society that the servers of Wikipedia are owned, and thus they can be genuinely attacked and need to be defended, it is reasonable to consider that no individual owns the content or direction of Wikipedia.

Affectations of ''article ownership'' -- &quot;defending&quot; an article that one has worked on from all comers, as if it were one's own territory -- may represent false attachment. Wikipedia does not regard any contributor, no matter how good their contributions, as the owner or final arbiter of an article. Even a famous person may not own or control the article about him- or herself.

==Longer notes which probably belong in Wikipedia==
The Jainist conception of ahimsa involves three times three--the three actions (''karanas'') of himsa in the three modes (''yogas'')--of observances:

Neither mentally, orally, or physically
# do injury oneself (''krita'')
# get others to do injury (''karita'') 
# approve injury done by others (''anumata'', ''mananat'', or ''anumodana'')

The ten noble virtues (''dharma'') are:
# supreme forgiveness or forbearance (''uttama kshama'')
# supreme humility or tenderness (''uttama mardava'')
# supreme honesty or straight forwardness (''uttama arjava'')
# supreme contentment or purity of thought and freedom from greed
# supreme truth (''uttama satya'')
# supreme self-control or self-restraint (''uttama samyama'')
# supreme austerities
# supreme renunciation
# supreme non-attachment or not taking the non-self for one's own self (''uttama akinchana'')
# supreme chastity (''uttama brahmacharya'')


Note the similarites to the Biblical virtues of the excellent wife: humility, forbearance, love, and diligence [Philippians 4:2,3], upon which Larry Wall, the founder of Perl, has famously expounded.
&lt;cite&gt;
:Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. These are virtues of passion. They are not, however, virtues of community. The virtues of community sound like their opposites: diligence, patience, and humility.  They're not really opposites, because you can do them all at the same time. It's another matter of perspective. These are the virtues that have brought us this far. These are the virtues that will carry our community into the future, if we do not abandon them. 
&lt;/cite&gt;

----
I'm not sure if this is any clearer, but it makes more references to Wikipedia:

Actually, in many ways, I'm advocating a return to the philosophy expressed in [[w:Our Replies to Our Critics|Our Replies to Our Critics]] as opposed to that in [[w:The Wikipedia Militia|The Wikipedia Militia]]. 'Our Replies' is confident and optimistic, and says things like: 
:The more people there are to abuse it, the more people there are to ward off the abuse: if all the writers are also editors (see Wikipedia policy), the few malicious elements are hopeless outgunned. As traffic increases, so does the number of people who work on and care about the project. We do not have a static number of &quot;editors&quot; who are responsible for editing everything; the number of people who do editing-type work increases directly in proportion to the number of people working on the encyclopedia. 
and:
:It's simply false to say that Wikipedia has no standards -- the standards we follow are those followed by each of its contributors, and in some cases, these are very high standards indeed. As we gain more traffic, we will continue to gain more expert help, and as gaps are filled in, the only way remaining for Wikipedia to improve in will be in quality and depth. This, in turn, is likely to attract more experts, who follow their own very high standards. 

:To make a claim about what standards Wikipedia follows is to make a claim about what present and future Wikipedia contributors follow; to say that such people have no standards is little more than a baseless insult based in ignorance. 
whereas Militia says:
:Now consider the possibility that we are suddenly invaded with, say, fifty times that amount of traffic. It could be a major disaster. The face of Wikipedia could change overnight, and for the worse. So it would help considerably if we were prepared to help preserve the quality of articles and the positive elements of the Wikipedia ethos. 

I support the Replies philosophy (note the very different titles), which is essentially, as long as we 1) each make the contributions we want and 2) support each other (this includes helping new contributors jump in), then we don't have to worry (in an organized sense) about malicious elements or preserving the quality of articles.

The Replies philosophy (or WikipediAhimsa) is supported by the facts laid out in the Replies article: the number of helpful and well-intentioned contributors will always greatly outweigh the number of malicious or poor contributors, unless we do something to actively drive away helpful contributors (by, for example, creating hierarchies, or attacking idiosyncracy or difference of opinion on Wikipedia policy). This was borne out for the beginning of the project, no organization against &quot;vandals&quot; and &quot;dross&quot; was necessary.

I argue that organizing against &quot;vandals&quot; and &quot;dross&quot; begets such problems: violence begets violence. Branding people as vandals and contributions as dross breeds ill-will, conflict, and antagonism.

The nature of organizations formed to combat problems is that they work to find problems, whether or not they exist. When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail. The meter maid has a ticket quota, and will overenforce parking policy; the police force who sees its job as to arrest bad people will make unnecessary arrests; the FBI who sees its job as to root out threats to the United States will call too many people threats; the military who sees its job as to fight wars will fight wars, whether or not that was the best course of action.

And because organizations are inherently self-sustaining and resist critical feedback, they generally end up making big mistakes -- police brutality, surveillance and persecution of MLK, etc., Vietnam -- before the criticism catches up with them.

Better to just not make such organizations unless it is scientifically evident that no alternative exists; and then to encourage criticism of the organizations at all times.

From the ahimsa perspective: only because we are imperfect and self-attached can himsa ever be necessary -- as we all strive for perfection and the non-self (and the Jainists state that the best way to achieve that is through self-suffering), we strive to abandon himsa in all things.

A prime example of WikipediAhimsa is [[w:What_Wikipedia_is_not|What Wikipedia is not]], which presents edicts and counter-edicts -- self-criticism at work.

Violent vs. non-violent: my &quot;How to Destroy Wikipedia&quot; vs. &quot;How to Build Wikipedia&quot;. (Though I do submit that Destroy was more honest; however, the harm it caused in distressing others unnecessarily and intentionally outweighs that honesty. Best would have been a critical but not vicious article.)

Violent vs. non-violent: deletion vs. editing. If you delete, you should justify your actions fully. If your deletion is questioned, you should respond fully. It is easier to delete than to edit -- that should not justify deletion. Similarly with restoring previous versions. Satya requires information -- imperfect knowledge is better than no knowledge. (Though confusion is also bad. These things all counterweight each other.)


Gandhi discusses ahimsa much more clearly:

My (naive) opinion is that the sum total of wikipedia policy should really be: write good articles.  Vandalism isn't yet a great problem, though it seems sensible to have some sort of loose agreement that everybody will chip-in when it does occur. I doubt that anybody is seriously suggesting that &quot;Wikipedia policy should follow the spirit... of violence.&quot; It also seems sensible not to take any Japanese analogies too seriously, I couldn't imagine a community that was more different - [[user:sodium|sodium]]

Dude, [http://belief.net/index/index_10040.html I ain't Japanese], I can tell you that. --SunirShah

:Sorry 'Dude' :) 
----

I think WikipediAhimsa gets closer to the ideas in [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity MeatBall:SoftSecurity] that are built into UseModWiki (though not ''this'' page). The militia is very far away from those ideas, indeed approaching a [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PoliceForce MeatBall:PoliceForce] which is [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?HardSecurity MeatBall:HardSecurity]. But it's your choice how you go forward. If it makes you feel any better, my parents are Jains, so definitely Jainism has influenced my violent arguments in favour of soft security. ;) --SunirShah

----
Sodium: I don't think your opinion is exactly naive...I actually think that's about all the policy Wikipedia needs! ... btw, Jains aren't Japanese! :)

Rather than violence, I think you might agree that people are suggesting that Wikipedia policy should be more  [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?HardSecurity MeatBall:HardSecurity] than [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity MeatBall:SoftSecurity].

There are many differences between &quot;some sort of loose agreement that everybody will chip-in when vandalism does occur&quot; and The Wikipedia Militia, as it's now presented.

SS: Thanks for pointing those links out -- I'm glad that I'm reinventing the wheel here, because it implies that I'm not completely offbase. What do you mean by ''not &quot;this&quot; page''?

It's funny -- my arguments in favor of soft security reflect a very post-modern influence; namely, I'm influenced by the free software movement, which was influenced by the civil rights movement, which was influenced by Gandhi, who was influenced by the Jains. I only looked up the Jainist concept of ahimsa for the writing of this article.  &quot;Soft security&quot; also is rooted in the Enlightenment, and is codified in the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. (You might call the Western version &quot;selfish soft security&quot; and the Eastern version &quot;selfless soft security&quot; if you wanted to extend the alliteration.)

Brin's ''The Transparent Society'' makes this point very well.

--[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

I think this page pushes things too far and fails to get ''it''. For instance, &quot;If you delete, you should justify your actions fully. If your deletion is questioned, you should respond fully.&quot; This isn't right. In a healthy organization, the members trust each other enough to not demand full explanations. It should be apparent from the diff what was before and what is now, and since we [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?AssumeGoodFaith MeatBall:AssumeGoodFaith], we assume the editors are trying their best. If you find something lacking, you should be constructive in your criticism, ala &quot;I don't think you should have deleted Sarah's statement. It was valid, and worth keeping.&quot; Or, even better, just fold Sarah's statement directly into the text yourself. This is how the [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?BarnRaising MeatBall:BarnRaising] works.

On the other hand, if you choose to take the route of hard security, you already begin by assuming ''bad'' faith. This leads to a cycle of mistrust and even more overt and excessive demands of the contributors. The question is, since everyone has the [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RightToLeave MeatBall:RightToLeave], at what point does this become so ennervating that your best contributors leave, sifting out all but the rottenest apples to take control? 

Finally, I don't think you should take free software as your guide. Free software is rife with [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GodKing MeatBall:GodKing]s. The [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RightToFork MeatBall:RightToFork] just isn't sufficient enough to support this ''direct democracy''. And I mean real democracy, not that pansy voting BS that everyone associates with democracy. (Remember, [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?VotingIsEvil MeatBall:VotingIsEvil].) --SunirShah

----
I don't at all agree that Militia/Guard is following ideas from HardSecurity. Out of the 8 points listed only the 2nd - to temporarily excile people - has been speculatively discussed (but not with much seriousness, and nobody has suggested it should be incorporated in to the guard). The Wikipedia Guard is significantly different from a PoliceForce in that *anybody* can join and they have *no* special powers - this is far from trying to 'impose force from &quot;above&quot;'. In fact the Guard is based on the main idea in SoftSecurity, the AuditTrail. It is enforced through the second idea - ReversibleChange. 

Ahimsa seems to make sense:
:&quot;neither do injury oneself, get injury done by others, or approve injury done by others&quot;
But I don't think its neccesary to adopt an old philosophy (whatever nationality it is :) ), we should instead attempt to forge a new one.
-- [[user:sodium|sodium]]

First, I think Wikipedia deserved the increase in spam it got after spamming kuro5hin. Similarly, if it publishes a press release and an influx of people exceeds your ability to absorb them, you also deserve what you get. You can only absorb so many newcomers at a time, so you shouldn't artificially exceed that. That's the beginning of the violence cycle. I recognize it might seem &quot;cool&quot; to be really popular, but Larry would essentially eliminate the social structure that the volunteers have created by flooding it with newbies. Then again, the trade off is a short period of spam against new contributors. Business is business, eh.

Also consider that newbies always bring new expectations that conflict with the existing social structure. This can be bad, but only if those expectations can't be listened to and addressed. It's not valid to be xenophobic, after all. But it's not going to help you if you have to debase the newbies by lumping them together as some sort of collective &quot;force of nature&quot; instead of interacting with them individually.

Second, I don't think it's necessary to declare something as patently absurd and hostile towards newcomers as a militia, even it is voluntary and is facetious. When we protected ZWiki after it was Slashdotted, we just put a notice on MeatballWiki's RecentChanges as a call to action. I think it's just the wrong attitude. Don't create cliques. The entire wiki is voluntary (*); it's not fair to think the militia is ''more'' voluntary than normal contributors. -- SunirShah

(*) Except Larry for at least forty hours of the week, of course. ;)

Er... I understand that not everyone liked the K5 articles, but I hardly think they can be called &quot;spam&quot;, since the K5 community voted them both to the front page. To the best of my knowledge, Wikipedia didn't mobilize a voting bloc to push them through deceptively. ''I call everything spam. See http://advogato.org/article/384.html as another recent example. Don't get ''too'' worked up over it. --ss''
:I'm not worked up about it at all. But I do encourage you to be more discriminating in your use of the term. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

As for the &quot;militia&quot;, I'm starting to partially agree with you. It really doesn't serve any purpose to have a listing of members; a notice of an influx of traffic on Recent Changes and over the mailing list would suffice. And I can see how it would seem offensive to newcommers. So, I'm off to visit [[w:The Wikipedia Militia|The Wikipedia Militia]] to register my developing opinion... --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

== Deletionism ==

Being a deletionist, in my humble opinion, does not really violate the principle of ahimsa. While the essay does not attempt to give a scholarly account of the subject, as it stands, it's slightly misleading. When deleting text you should be aware of who contributed and be considerate. However, you should also equally consider the users of the encyclopedia, accordingly deleting information that is unsupported by references may be appropriate. In conclusion, ahimsa is about considering others, but does not equate to wiki inclusionism. [[User:80.189.85.150|80.189.85.150]] 18:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

== Philippians 4:2,3 ==

It doesn't say anything particularly obviously connected with the &quot;virtues of the excellent wife&quot;:

:I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord. Yes, and I ask you, loyal yokefellow, help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

Is there some other passage the writer was thinking of? [[User:66.92.237.111|66.92.237.111]] 15:29, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

== Delete ==
Can someone please delete this article. I wont even go into why I want it deleted
[[User:71.238.71.180|71.238.71.180]] 00:59, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

== Please move to the correct namespace ==

Someone should move this out of the main namespace.  It is currently linked from the [[WP:UNDO]] page, but the link is dead when transcluded off of this project. [[Special:Contributions/71.182.185.125|71.182.185.125]] 20:04, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;even if you approve of the results&quot; is confusing ==

This is confusing; I don't think this means it's okay to approve the results after the injury's been done, but syntax of sentence suggests that meaning as a possibility. I think it means &quot;even if you think the results would be nice, don't condone the act of injury to achieve those results.&quot; Right? Could use edit for clarity? --''moved from article page [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=WikipediAhimsa&amp;diff=1006324&amp;oldid=976974  2008-05-23T14:21:51 71.62.145.230 (Talk) (9,993 bytes) (→Adherence to ahimsa:  prettier formatting, &amp; make second-person voice consistent :))]''

I think &quot;oneself&quot; is to not limiting the meaning to &quot;yourself&quot;.  It may mean anyone.  You may do ahimsa by injuring the others. --[[User:Ans|Ans]] 11:28, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

I hope that I'm chosen! --Alan D

These are funny as hell!! In ALL seriousness, one of these should be considered as the METApedia logo - maybe the &quot;Wanna fight&quot; or the &quot;One billion unfinished entries.&quot; We need a sense of humour about our project. - [[user:Manning Bartlett|Manning Bartlett]]

Ha! Charles is my favourite. --Stephen G.
:But he was just edged out by the monkeys... --STG

Actually, I must be showing my total lack of a sense of humor in finding most of these just pretty stupid, and not very funny at all. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Hmmm... you didn't like Wikipedia Anti-Rules, either. Perhaps you don't go for self-depreciating humour? Obviously Manning and I do. Of course, we're nothing but a couple of warped bastards anyway, so what do we know? ;-)  --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

Hmm, but I do like self-deprecating humor!  I engage in it quite a lot!  I wouldn't call either this page or the Wikipedia Anti-Rules page as funny self-deprecating humor, though.  I dunno, they both strike me pretty obviously as attempts to hurt more than an attempt to poke fun at ourselves in a lighthearted fashion.  Just for example, the &quot;Wanna fight&quot; logo is unfunny to me because it implies, or seems to imply, that we ''like'' fighting, which I don't think we really do.  (I don't like it, which is a shame, because I seem to get into so much of it professionally. :-) )  The Charles logo seems to imply that we find it funny that total wackos can write for Wikipedia; er, well, I don't find that particularly funny.  I find it to be a cause for concern.  The Fartboy logo makes it look as if we find Fartboy funny, which, of course, he simply isn't at all.  He's simply a tiresome little idiot.

You want to know what actually funny self-deprecating humor about Wikipedia would be like?  Something more like &quot;Watch out, Britannica!  We won't suck for long!&quot;

Of course I'm not trying to educate your sense of humor--no point in that.  I'm ''just'' expressing my opinion here. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
No worries. I'm not here to critique your sense of humour either. But, let me tell you why I find these funny. They play on the common criticisms of Wikipedia which I consider to hold no (well,  very little) water. In fact, some of these things are our strengths. These logos are exaggerations of those criticisms, blown up to absurd proporations. 

*The Charles Manson logo: People say that any ol' wacko can come along and write here. Sure, but see how long wacko material lasts! It's usually gone in less than five minutes.
*&quot;Wanna fight?&quot;: People say that such a project will amount to nothing more than a stupid collection of partisan wrangling. Yes, we have fights, but they're usually dealt with remarkably smoothly. Plus, it's a very well done Fight Club parody.
*&quot;Fartboy&quot;: This place is going to just fill up with vandalism and nonsense, right? Wrong! We've proven that vandals find Wikipedia to be a hostile environment for their &quot;art&quot;. Vandals do things like that for a reaction. Want to ruin their fun? Undo the damage and refuse to take them seriously.
*&quot;A million monkeys&quot;: This one's just a play on the old monkeys at a typewriter banging out Hamlet. Things is, we know that it takes Shakespeare to write Hamlet, and it takes Wikipedians to build Wikipedia.

Someone told me something once, and it's always stuck with me: if you want to tease people, but don't want to hurt their feelings, poke fun at their strengths. That's what these mock logos do, in my opinion. All these things that people say are Wikipedia's fatal weaknesses are turning out to be our strengths. And that's what I find funny.

Wow, that was long that I expected... --[[user:Stephen Gilbert]]
----
I had NO intention of being mean, nor to endorse wackos, fighting or vandalism. As a matter of fact, I found fartboy's contribution hilarious, but I don't support that either. I don't think the Wikipedia is a waste of time, and I do not, Larry, think you are a fart (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.) I just wanted to have a little fun and share it with my friends. I'm sorry if some people didn't find it very funny, but in retrospect I cannot blame you for not finding jabs at your bread and butter comedic. I apologize. But to SG, you pretty much said what I wanted to convey, so thanks for putting it so succintly.

--Alan D 

----
Sorry, Larry, but aparently you are not going to be able to
find funny anything that attacks in any way wikipedia...
I agree with Stephen Gilbert's analysis of whats funny in these logos...they are funny in a very mean, black way, though. I still think that you have a sense of humor, but
it's completely shut down by your defensive instinct when
you feel wikipedia attacked...and it's fine! we want
our self apointed dictator for life defending Wikipedia
against everything...(and we will with you :)) [[user:AstroNomer|AstroNomer]] 
----
I think they're hilarious.  [[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]
----
Being stuck with a zillion books to learn till next week, these logos are the highlight of my day (sorry, Larry, we're just too silly). I think both the Manson and the monkey one would make a nice logo for the meta wiki. I'd vote for the monkey one, though, because many non-U.S. people might just not make the Manson connection (it took me a while, too). --[[Magnus Manske]]
----
Personally, I do find some of them quite funny. I think stuff like this is essential in building a sort of &quot;Wikipedia culture&quot;. I have been around for over 10 months now and I see the project as my second home on the web. Heh, you can't expect us to write articles 24/7 ;-) [[user:WojPob|+wojpob]]
----
I want the monkey to appear on the regular logo on April Fools Day! --MichaelTinkler

----
Yep, Larry, you're in the minority here.  I wouldn't propose actually ''using'' any of them, even on meta, but they are hilarious.  Think of them as condensed commentary. --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]
----
OK, OK, I do get the point.  Yes, maybe I'm a little overdefensive when it comes to Wikipedia.  :-) --[[LMS]]
----
Ok, am I the only one who likes the McDonald's parady image?  That gets my vote.  --[[ChuckSmith]]

'''&quot;The Klezmer Perplexion of a Mountain Goat&quot;'''

The mountains, the mountains, my mountains made of cloud. The thin walls of air spiralling through my permanently dividing shoebox of extreme conciousness, my burning tongue inside a skull, the skull, my skull made of paper. The wind laughed at me, and patted my back. My ears told me to forget what they told me. My eyes listened but didn't believe me. My heart was reading, my blood splashed in waves inside my caverns. I am a goat, or so I hear. I am a Wikipedian, but can I feel trust?

----

I'm not sure that I am a [[Wikipedian]] yet, but I intend to become one. It's the astonishing similarity to the [[Wikipedia:Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy`|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] that ensnared me. That was my first favorite book. I read it in seventh grade, in the back of my math class, and got busted for laughing out loud. In the book, the Guide is written by volunteers and full of mistakes and innacuracies. What a great way to collect knowledge though. And Wikipedia is growing--it comes up in like 5 out of 10 google searches. It's full of useful info, accurate or not, and it's making people's lives better. And I can contribute to it. I've already created a couple entries, including one for [[w:The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby]] and no one seems to have objected. I'm working on developing my technique and hoping to tackle some more extensive articles. I also might write a travel guide to [[w:Hampton Roads]], where I live. It's so rare to find a site like this where there's an opportunity to be relevant to the world. I'm ready to be a part. I'm ready to be [[Wikipediafied]].

&lt;b&gt; In a galaxy far, far away...&lt;/b&gt;

It was a cold Friday evening in January 2001. I was on duty in one of my uni's [http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/zid/ computer labs]. It was about 6 p.m. and I had three hours to go until I could lock-up and leave for a pint of lager in my [http://www.shebeen.at/ favourite pub]. I had hardly anything to do -the few students who were hanging around were busy with some hardcore C++ programming, at levels which were out of my reach anyway.

I knew bomis.com for some time now, and while I was clicking my way through, looking for something that could distract my attention for a while, I stumbled upon the [http://www.bomis.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl Bomis wiki] (someone gave it a fancy name of 'Bomis board' later on). What I saw there was utter chaos - scattered info about busty female actresses combined with other forms of verbal abuse. I had never heard about the wiki concept before so I started to experiment by making a few useless entries ([http://www.bomis.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BeeR beer rules] was the first one). Having satisfied my childish needs I decided it was time for something more serious. I saw a link to wikipedia on the bomis homepage so I gave it a try.

At first I was a bit intimidated about the entries and discussions, which I saw there. The main contributors at the time were [[user:Jimbo_Wales|Jimbo]], [[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry]] and [[w:Josh Grosse]]. The 'Pedia had ca. 700 (!) entries, and was still using the weird Camel Case format, which made links appear in the manner of [[w:PortugaL]] or [[w:PolanD]]. After a bit of lurking around I quickly figured out what the purpose of the project was, and came to the simple conclusion &quot;Me likes thees!&quot;.

What followed were normal symptoms of my gradual turning into a [[w:Wikipediholic]]. I spent a large portion of my free time starting entries, editing, and cross-linking. I witnessed the project grow gradually and in waves as it became more popular (slashdotting, etc.). During the Summer, doing the hard job of an analyst at a medium-sized Polish financial institution kept me away for a while. I was back in mid-September. And I intend to stay for as long as I can, or until my cable modem dies on me.

Cheers,&lt;br&gt;

'''Confessions of a Soap Opera Addict'''

I used to post on [http://www.wost.org the message board at the World of Soap Themes]. Someone came and said, ooh, look what I found! It's this site called Wikipedia! He said, oh, I put a link to the theme site under soap operas!

'''Jaberwocky6669'''  I first became a member when I used the Ivan the Terrible article to help me complete a school paper.  I had used WIkipedia in the past but was quite elated to see the button on the bottom that said &quot;Edit this page&quot;.  I thought that it must be some kind of a joke or a catch-22.  I clicked it and here is the dramatic part.  I vandalized a page!  The page was the article about women.  I have since been rehabilitated and I can't listen to classical music without going crazy!  =)

'''FinalGamer'''  Well, I was surfing the net as per usual until on a forum I frequented, I saw a portal.  A link, engraved in blue of one name. . .Wikipedia. . .I wondered, &quot;freaky name, must be some D &amp; D fanatic site or so&quot;. . .but I was wrong.  I clicked the link in bored curiosity, and before you know it, this place has become my favourite site ever.  My first article to make was [[w:Fatal_Frame]] and I was so amazed at this place.  A virtual encyclopaedia for all who float in cyberspaace, a font for humans across the world to pool their knowledge into.  It gripped me, it made me gasp. . .it made me a Wikipedian.
And I even got the full &quot;vandalised user page&quot; mark to prove it.

[[en:User:Davy Blue|Dave]] I really don't recall exactly how when or why I found Wiki. It's sort of like asking someone the first time they heard of Coca-Cola or Xerox or any other product that is so commonly used that it's become a part of the language and culture.

'''Anonunit'''

I am not sure when exactly I found out about Wikipedia. Every time I did research for something, &quot;Wikipedia&quot; kept coming up. I think that for a while, I avoided Wikipedia, thinking that it would not be reliable. 

Anyway, eventually I wanted to learn more about Wikipedia. So, I decided to sign up. I think that was sometime earlier this year or maybe last year. I knew about Wikipedia long before that, but I was not as interested as I was then.

My first two edits were on my user page and my talk page, which you can hopefully see on the bottom of this page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Anonunit&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500 here.]

Then, out of nowhere, I noticed that somebody made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Graphicsphere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11234129 two] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Graphicsphere&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11245986 edits] using my account. It was about Graphicsphere or something. I have no idea how that happened.

Anyway, a few weeks later, I decided to make my first edit on [[en:New Orleans, Louisiana|an article that wasn't my user page or user talk page]], just to see what would happen. It appeared as if it worked fine, it was not removed, and I was not warned for doing anything wrong. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana&amp;diff=26830598&amp;oldid=22783909 On September 7, 2005, at 09:47,] however, it seemed as if somebody called [[en:User:Derek.cashman|Derek.cashman]] had removed it. Derek.cashman left an edit summary saying, &quot;''rv speculation in opening paragraph by Anonunit.''&quot; I assumed that Derek.cashman thought that I wrote that entire paragraph, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22761659 even though I had only corrected a single typo in that paragraph as a test.] Since I did not know how to respond to that, I stayed quiet and was relieved that I was not banned from Wikipedia or anything like that.

A few days later, I decided to make some more edits. I was trying to figure out how Wikipedia worked, and since the Sandbox did not appeal to me, I decided to test out my skills on my user page.

At some point, somebody seemed to have left a message on my talk page saying, “''I’d fuck you.''” It disappeared shortly after. I was not sure whether it was exactly my talk page, or if I confused it with somebody else’s talk page, since I had many windows open at that time. The message may have been deleted from the history of my talk page as an act of vandalism.

I messed around a lot for a few hours, until I noticed the Sun rising, and I decided to stop.

I continued to use Wikipedia for many weeks after that, but I never felt as if I had the chance to edit something.

A few weeks later, I decided to participate on many articles that were not related to anything very important. They were just categories and lists of Wikipedians. I even registered to Meta-Wiki.

The day I wrote this, I made my first article. The article was about [[en:Pascale Hutton|Pascale Hutton]].

'''Tedius Zanarukando'''

I became a Wikipedian on August 23, 2003.  I happened to run into Wikipedia through Yahoo search engine.  I took a good look at a Star Wars related article and then some other film related article.  I later found that there are video game related articles.  The first game related article I viewed was about the [[en:Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy series]], and that inspired me to become a Wikipedia   The first article I made was [[en:Enhanced remake]].  The second article I made was [[en:Fan translation]].  My only featured article was about the video game [[en:Final Fantasy X|''Final Fantasy X'']].  Some of the articles I started have undergone radical ending.  In June 2006, I began to incorporate userboxes into my userpage and have created some userboxes.

Well. my question is if i really am a Wikipedian. i would like to think that i am; however, i have only been here for 5 months and in that time i have done verry little to improve Wikipedia but to fix a word or two here or their. i have created an acount in all Wikimedia projects just for the heck of it.

The real reason i made an acount was because my school was full of vandles and it was the only way to eddit. it has grow; however, to an apseson

'''FastLizard4'''
Well, I was editing Wikipedia from school, and got annoyed at how the school IP was being blocked.  So, I noticed the &quot;create account&quot; button, and thought I would give it a go.  So, in August 2006, I created an account with the name &quot;FastLizard4&quot;, looked around, maybe made two or three edits.  Then, I forgot about Wikipedia, and didn't come back until I was editing from my grandfather's house while I was on vacation.  I created one of the lamest excuses of a userpage ever, with an average 2 edits per month in all namespaces for March and April of 2007.  Then, in May 2007, with the advent of a new, exponentially larger Wikipedia userpage (blame the userboxes), I now edit Wikipedia ferociously.  Wikipedia proved so fun, I gave up playing Runescape!  --[[User:FastLizard4|FastLizard4]] 03:57, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

As usual, as always, I was jumping from one page to another, looking for the meaning of several words for my translations. Suddenly, one day in 2007 I started reading the userpages of one or more wikipedians... and my interest started. As soon as I began doing my first edition, interest was activated inside: I started editing, writing, translating... more and more (contributing in Meta, in French, a bit also in German). Now I am working, along with several other wikipedians, in the creation of Wikimedia Mexico. As a psychologist and certified translator, I am very interested in the exchange of information (now I am also uploading photos), in the diffusion of science and knowledge, in learning &quot;for the sake of learning,&quot; as ReuvenYisrael is saying a few lines above.

I first became aware of Wikipedia sometime around 2006. I believe this  is when Google results started popping up Wikipedia entries at the top of the search page (?)

I got involved in editing Wikipedia during the [[w:Ontario general elections]] of 2007 after publicly communicating with one of the local candidates through a [[w:Yahoo! Group]]. The candidate said he  could not post information about himself at Wikipedia, so I started an article about him, however, I found the  experience so deflating I stopped contributing and only started again around 2010-2011.

=== WWW-Mediawiki-Client ===
[[WWW::Mediawiki::Client|WWW-Mediawiki-Client]] has been and continues to be in development as a Perl library and a small wrapper script, which behaves a lot like a CVS client, allowing users to do updates to download Mediawiki content, and commits to upload content.

== Comments ==

I am unsatisfied with using a web-browser to edit content. I am unsatisfied with switching between editors and other applications to use Wikipedia. I am unsatisfied with the latency and pull nature of the &quot;RecentChanges&quot; link. I am unsatisfied with the lack of immediate collaboration on articles, i.e. people working on the same document truly simulateneously.

These are all limitations that are imposed on the Wikipedia user by web interfaces, and they are not going to go away anytime soon. The only solution is to create a client that can access Wikipedia and which provides these features. Such a client would not replace the existing web interface, of course: it would merely be an additional, more effective way for advanced users to use Wikipedia.

Specificially, the client should

* include a (visual) editor with Wikipedia-specific features and allow integration of alternative editor components
* automatically fetch RecentChanges updates in regular intervals
* make it very simple to navigate revisions, for example with a two-panel window that highlights differences
* integrate with the Wikipedia IRC channel
* when two users open the same document with the client, allow collaboration mode: a chat is opened, and one user can assume control of the cursor and mouse
* cache articles locally and allow offline browsing, searching and indexing of wikipedia tarballs
* do anything else you can think of.

To implement such a beast, at first one would only be able to hack the existing Wikipedia using the &quot;protocol&quot; as defined by the HTML layout and forms. This is a very unsatisfying solution, and eventually, the Wikipedia server should learn to accept standardized XML-RPCs.

The actual implementation could go forward in several steps. At first, a simple browser/editor component would be the most important: Being able to navigate and use Wikipedia without an actual web-browser would be nice. More advanced features could be implemented later.

I would personally very much like to use such a client, and possibly be interested in writing it (in my case, likely in C++/Qt or C/GTK). Is there any broader interest in such a tool?

Oh dear god, not XML-RPC! I agree that having to parse out the
table of contents and extra links and so forth is bad, but
there are ways to do what we need via plain old HTTP. For instance,
to get the raw data for a page, you might use a URL like &quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/some_article?output=raw&quot;.
It would also be nice to be able to get the page as HTML, but
without the extra links, like so:
&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/some_article?output=html&quot;.
- TOGoS

:I agree that XML-RPC (or SOAP or WebDAV) feels like overkill. A simple XML ''return'' format for things like recentchanges, history, and metadata (author, revision date) might be useful, but plain old HTTP should provide all the ''calling'' semantics we need. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 01:34 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)

You're right. I like to complain about XML (I think XML-RPC is especially over-hyped), but it has its place. Anyway... What I'm really thinking is that the interface between the server and the client should be as simple and intuitive as possible. For instance (to expand on what I already said), to update a page, you would just do a PUT (or POST, more likely) request to 'http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_name' with the new raw wiki data as the body of the request. Right now, with the web interface, you have to post data to some weird, non-inintuitve URL. I know the client would take care of this (and I actually don't really mind it for the web interface), but having a simple, intuitive, not-bound-to-the-implementation client-server interface has a number of benefits:
* makes the system more modular
* easier job for the implementors
* we don't want our computers to end up speaking the equivalent of English, do we? (go loglan!)
So I think it would be worth it in the long run to do a little extra work to get the server to understand a more intuitive 'language'. What'sit running? Apache...? Might take a little work. But hey, that's what Ruby's for. Write your own server! (Perhaps this rant belongs on another page. Feel free to move it if you think so.)

==== In Defense of XML-RPC (SOAP) ====

# XML-RPC (let's say SOAP) may seem like overkill, but I predict that using standards will pay off in unpredictable ways.  Instead of people having to learn about our oh-so-minamlistic HTTP based protocol, they can just leverage what SOAP skills that have now.  
# Relying on a standard gives us room to grow because we can trust that the standard-makers have had a little more time to think issues through.  It would be embarassing to find ourselves gradually extending our minimalistic protocol, little piece here and there, and before we know it finding that we have just reinvented SOAP.  
# Now (Nov 2003), SOAP implementations have reached the level of maturity that we don't really have to do any extra parsing work ourselves.
# XML-RPC and SOAP have ready-made libs on all moderns langages (php, python, perl, java, C, C++, C#, visual basic, ruby ... even javascript) and are integrated in large edition frameworks (like OpenOffice.org, Mozilla/XUL, Eclipse and so on). So those would accelerate clean and fast integration on tierce applications (eg. even making a MS-Office based client would be easy through visualbasic/soap).
# It became a common choice for other wikis softs opening their API (at least for phpwiki, moinmoin, jspwiki, twiki, usemod and openwiki), so this lead to unification in some way.

First, I don't quite understand the first paragraph.  Can you expand on these problems you see?  For instance, I don't see how it's a bad thing that we can't work on articles &quot;truly simulateneously.&quot;

Wouldn't the disadvantages of such a tool (mainly, having to download it--whereas at present anybody with a web browser can edit Wikipedia) trump the advantages of ''requiring'' a Wikipedia editing program? --172.139.98.xxx (which is to say, [[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] in the field :-) )

The existence of a separate client for editing pages (as opposed to merely reading them) might also serve as a useful ''pons asinorum'' for editors. --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]
----
We could probably have a dual interface option: you can use your browser for quick access, or download the client for increased functionality.

I'd be interested in such a beast. However, I'm not sure about the real-time collaboration mode. I don't think everyone gets along well enough to work in real-time. ;-)

For the record, the Opera web browser has a feature to automatically reload any page at set intervals. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

Oh, one more thing. Have you ever used the wxWindows library? (http://www.wxwindows.org) It's a C++ framework designed for cross-platform programming. I'm told it plays nicer with Win32 than either QT or GTK. --Stephen G.
----
I'd recommend writing something that would work as an add-on to Mozilla. I suspect most of the functionality desired is already built-in or is available in other plugins already. Also, it seems to be the easiest way to construct platform-agnostic software these days. --TheCunctator
----
Wow, thanks for all the feedback. First, my idea was never to replace the web interface, but only to provide an additional way to access Wikipedia for regular users. However, I think the client could have some features that the web interface does not offer (e.g. collaborative editing), which would always be optional for all concerned parties to use.

I'm familiar with Opera's nice reloading feature, but for the client I would, at least in the long term, envision something different, namely a refresh that only shows changes made after the last load. This would require both additional client and server intelligence, but would drastically reduce the bandwidth required for refreshes. The Recent Changes page, especially when very large, takes hundreds of kilobytes, and reloaded in regular intervals, generates quite significant amounts of traffic. Now, I certainly hope that Wikipedia's financial situation is good, but from a cost-benefit-analysis, it is clear that the money saved by having a low-footprint refresh would easily outweigh the time requierd to implement the server and client intelligence.

Regarding wxWindows, yes, I have seen it in action, but never used it myself. It may be a good alternative to Qt or GTK.

Mozilla expansion -- hmm, I'm not sure about that, there's nothing in Mozilla (not even the web browser component) that I would like the client to support, rather, it would render the limited subset of HTML Wikipedia uses directly. This would make it possible to write a small combined browser/editor component (what the web browser should have been in the first place). - Eloq.
:Ah, I see. Recent Changes does indeed eat up bandwidth; it's been a source of problems for us in the past when floods of new traffic came in. [[w:Jimbo Wales]] could tell you more about that.

:A mozilla plugin makes a lot of sense to me. I usually have a number of tabs open for references when I'm editing, and the editor component integrated with my regular browser would be much easier to use than having to constantly switch applications. -- [[User:Arvindn|Arvindn]]

The UseModWiki RecentChanges already supports 'List new changes starting from t' where t is the last time you loaded RecentChanges (actually, it's the time of the last change you saw). Others have patched UseModWiki to put this in the user cookie ala MoinMoin. It isn't very difficult. See http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiPatches/ChangesSinceLastVisit. -- SunirShah

''Post from Intlwiki-l, Sat, 7 Dec 2002 17:54:48 +0100 (CET)''

I'm writing this to the international list because I
doubt the English Wikipedians care much about this
issue.  Today I received an email from a guy in Russia
who wants to start his own Esperanto encyclopedia
project because it costs too much to constantly be
online just to work on an encyclopedia and he wants to
distribute the encyclopedia on CD.  I also know that
we will NEVER have a Czech Wikipedia without it
because there is a communications monopoly which
requires all people (except very large companies) to
pay for the Internet by the minute at quite high rates
for the average Czech.

A Wikipedia client is desperately needed if we want
more work to be done on the non-English Wikipedias. 
Users will be able to have the entire encyclopedia (in
whichever languages they want) on their hard drives
and it could syncronize when they connect to the
Internet.  Also, such a program MUST be non-English
user friendly.

Having a user-friendly process (preferably offline)
for people to translate the Wikipedia interface would
also speed up the process of getting new languages
into Wikipedia.

Could anyone please write such a program?


Thanks,
Chuck
----
just some thoughts:
a e-mail service for wikipedia, you send an email to a specific address (edit@cz.wikipedia.org for example) with a subjectline like:
:SEARCH Tristan Tzara
:You receive a mail with the search results.
:Then you write:
:GET Tristan Tzara (or whatever article title you want)
:You do your modifications offline and then you send:
:PUT Tristan Tzara, with your modified version in the body of the mail.

If nobody has changed the article in the meantime, the modifications are applied, else you get an editconflictmail...

To protect this service from spammers it could be limited to registered mail-addresses.

This would of course never work for the English Wikipedia, but for smaller Wikipedias, especially in such a situation as the Czech, it would be a possible solution which requires not much programming (at least I hope so - could this be  done easily?). Complete this with compressed HTML-versions of Wikipedias for download and offline reading. --[[User:Elian|elian]]

:If you don't send the changes in the form of the new version but as a unidiff, than most conflicts would be ignored. But that is already implemented and is called CVS, the only thing is that the Wikiserver must support that. --[[user:Bodo Thiesen|Bodo Thiesen]]
----
Bodo, 

I like your idea of the &quot;email search service for wikipedia.   I think it would also be nice to have a search app for SMS users, such as Google's [http://www.google.com/sms/ SMS service].

However, this could result in large returns being sent via the SMS.   To further expand on this idea, I believe that additional tags would need to be added to each Wikipedia page, in order to &quot;flag&quot; the most important info for return to the cellphone.

In turn, the Wikipedia SMS Search would be very similar to Bodo's email search idea, however, less information would be retrieved.

Both the Wikipedia email search and the SMS search should currently be possible without any changes to the Wikiserver.  There's already a search function on this site.  The client-side software would just need to truncate the &quot;wiki data&quot;.   However, this would require additional communication between the client and the Wikiserver.  Much of the processing would be moved to the client, however, a plug-in for Outlook would need to be created.  Not sure if it's even possible.

A better idea would be to do the truncating and delivery preparation at the server.

People talk about the implementation of &quot;a client&quot; here, but there can be
multiple ones. Some want instantaneous collaboration, others would prefer
to work offline, later merging their new stuff... I don't think ONE
implementation should address all these. Rather, publish a &quot;machine-friendly&quot;
interface spec atop of HTTP, using special URLs or whatever, and let
people start their own clients. (and share them, if they want so)
I've seen this debate &quot;i like C++&quot;/&quot;I use Rebol&quot;/&quot;Did you check wxWindows&quot;
multiple times before... come on - each his own - we just need a simple
machine friendly interface and things will get started. In fact, it should
be easier to do (on the side of Magnus Manske / the Wikipedia coders)
than a human-friendly interface.

----

Dirk's point about multiple clients is good. One client is the offline one, which may be most useful in countries with slow/expensive Internet access. Such a client needs to give the user access to all the entries, or at least, the ones  the user is most interested in (a slightly out-of-date version of the others might be delivered by CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, perhaps on magazine covers). 

If the user has access to all the entries and can navigate them... then they've got a duplicate Wikipedia system, so the quickest way to implement an offline reader is simply to put a local webserver on the user's machine, running the Wikipedia software. 

To allow the client to do offline ''editing'', use the same interface that Wikipedia uses (the user accesses the local Wikipedia using his web browser), but modify the server-side code so that it stores the edited articles separately, and can upload them to thev main wiki server, and at the same time download new versions of all the articles the user is tracking.

-- [[User:Cabalamat|Cabalamat]] 15:07, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)


Whiteboard support would be great. Please look into other projects like jabber that could be used to relize such things.

offline editing would be very important for the developing countries, at different levels: clients should be able to synchronize with servers AND servers should be able to synchronize with other servers e.g. once a day. That way it would be possible to build up a effective infrastructure for information deployment. Protocols and code exist already, please use it.

=== Modularisation of MediaWiki into Services ===
One of the current implementation weaknesses is that MediaWiki is not designed as distributed Environment from Ground up. If I would need to rewrite MediaWiki it should probably developed as (more or less) independend parts connected by Webservices. The Base for this would be to creating at least an elementary Classes Structure. In the big Picture:
*A Set of Webservices doing all the '''Database stuff''', so it will be more easily to port to the different Types/Versions of Databases. Ideally the Code in Background could using Factory-Patterns to make easy Databaseadaption possible.
*A Webservice for '''managing Users''' (Username, Password, User Roles, etc.). Because this is a task with high security requirements it should be used only via SSL or equivalent Encryption.
*A Webservice for '''converting Wikisyntax''' into a (not yet existing) WikiML. This will make it (optionally) possible to use different Syntaxes, so the user can decide in witch she is more familar. Also the use of a XML based Syntax will make it possible to use XSLT to format the output. 
*A Webservice for '''querying changes''' in the database. This will make it possible to let the user figure out if the cached Version in an Article is old. This technique could also make it possible to develop a kind of distributed MediaWiki, where users have a wiki-client witch is asking for changes in articles. If there are none the cached version within the client will be used. Otherwise just a (set of) diffgramm(s) will get served instead of the whole data. This technique might save bandwith and processing power.&lt;br/&gt;
In the case of overhead of Webservices I don't see any problems, because for MediaWiki internal Classes it will be still possible to to call the appropriate functions directly. The Webservices will get implemented as Wrappers.&lt;br/&gt;
The bigger Problems I see is the choosen Language PHP. Because this Scripting Language was originally not build for large Environments or Webservices it has some Drawbacks:
*It will run slower than compiled Code
*Implementation of Webservices will be more hard. Webservices is more easy in Environments like ASP.Net, witch  was build with Webservices in Mind. I'm recommending therefore to allow the use of [[en:Mono development platform|Mono]] and Java, as long as there public functions have SOAP-Wrappers.&lt;br/&gt;
The Advantages of an Service oriented Architecture would therefore be:
*Easy to extend by new Services based on the existing ones. Examples of such Services are the [[Special:Specialpages|Specialpages]].
*New Features might need new Interfaces. But extending parts of the application won't effect existing services.
*Easier distribution by mirroring just single Services over different Servers instead of the whole thing. Ie. User Handling might run on a single machine instead of get mirrored together with the rest of Wikipedia. Another Example might be the commons, witch might run on a different cluster witch in turn gets specialised on statical content.

== Initial efforts at a wkp-mode to view Wikipedia from Emacs ==

See my User page [[User:MwZurp]]. Still only does viewing but would like to extend to editing.

== Reuse what OS has to offer ==

1. XULrunner (new Mozilla product)
2. [http://www.fckeditor.net FCKreator] as a base for editing tools
3. Chatzilla extension for ICR colaboration

If Mozilla crue is on time with SVG implementation next level of data presentation is at reach. 
Choosing this approach will give us strong rendering engine and croos platform solution. 

== Modifying Existing Browsers? ==

What if, instead of building custom client software from scratch, we modify (extend, by adding custom features) existing web browsers (like Firefox, through extensions), and make them a full-fledged Wikipedia client? [[User:61.94.149.55|61.94.149.55]] 03:23, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

For example, see what [[w:flock (web browser)]] has done with integrating multiple blog services and clients into a browser. Any browser-integrated wiki client needs to be a bare-bones text-input place with buttons for all the typical functions. The buttons would not be defined at all at first, however -- you could select, say from a pulldown menu, a wiki that you were using (wikipedia? pm wiki? pb wiki? etc.) and the buttons would switch to that set of specific outputs to make sure that the font, etc. operators all worked for any wiki system. You could even let the users program their own buttons, etc. All sorts of macros and such would be possible. It'd be nice...better than these little wiki edit-pages by a lot, and still true to the spirit of integrating multiple functions into one area, and making it accessible for the layman.

== Access via WebServices ==
Long ago there was some discussion about implementing WebServices using NuSOAP, is anybody working on it? I would like to volunteer for that. Having Wiki accessible via alternate mechanism (such as SOAP, XML-RPC or even ATOM, RSS) could be of great use specially to handheld devices which have a limited display features. A compatible wiki-client can be installed on such devices and user can set preferences as of how the information (article, image, etc.) should be laid out. A well documented Web Services layer can be utilized by Desktop based client that provides extended features such as Editing, proof reading of articles etc.

''Slapped wholesale from [[w:DrinkOrDie/Talk]]. May be edited with goal of inclusion in [[w:Wikipedia FAQ]] (or not!)''

Three questions (bear in mind, they are ''just'' questions for you to think about):
* Is this properly an ''encyclopedia'' article or a ''news'' article?  Should we think that a developing news article is essentially the same as an encyclopedia article?
* Does this whole issue really deserve treatment ''in Wikipedia''?
* What is the purpose of the &quot;quotations&quot; section?
--[[Larry Sanger]]
----
The questions might be more neutrally phrased as:
* Is this written an ''encyclopedia'' article or a ''news'' article?  What are the differences between developing news article and an encyclopedia article?
* What is appropriate content ''in Wikipedia''?
* What is the purpose of the &quot;quotations&quot; section?

Some responses to those questions:

''What are the differences between developing news article and an encyclopedia article?''

It certainly should be written as an encyclopedia article. Developing articles in response to news has happened in the past, and will certainly continue to happen, unless deliberate efforts are made to stop that. Thus considerations of how to go from news-&gt;encyclopedia are important.

On one end would be the simple submittal of news articles straight from the wire into Wikipedia, perhaps wikifying the stories, with the expectation that over time the collaborative editing process would make them into encyclopedia-style entries.

On the other end would be a formal approval process of entries, with rigid style guides for appropriate subject matter, content and format, most likely taking earlier printed-matter encyclopedias as a guide.

The current norm is in between the two, largely through self-regulation plus a bit of peer pressure, mainly through bold editing, but sometimes through the Talk pages. People are expected to at a minimum start off entries with reasonable Wikipedia-style names. &quot;Feds raid software piracy ring&quot; would be an unreasonable entry; &quot;2001 acts of software copyright enforcement&quot; would be better but still bad (especially without more specific entries to link to). Entries which refer to specific entities are preferred.

''What is appropriate content?''

On one end would be any potentially verifiable data, enforced only by the collaborative editing process, with the expectation that any non-potentially-verifiable data would disappear over time. All decisions on appropriateness would be made on a case-by-case basis.

On the other end would be a formal approval process of entries, with rigid style guides for appropriate subject matter, content and format, most likely taking earlier printed-matter encyclopedias as a guide.

Again, the current norm is between the two, through the same mechanisms as above. Decisions on appropriate content are most often made on an ad hoc basis, following the non-content specific goal of neutral authority; the explicit policies on content (instead of style, etc.) mainly consider illegal content.

In this case, an entry on an organization which is the subject of multimillion-dollar criminal investigation is certainly appropriate. Over time the entry will be edited to emphasize what the informed consensus considers important and accurate, and deemphasize what the consensus considers unimportant, unclear, and inaccurate.

''What is the purpose of the &quot;quotations&quot; section?''

This section is not perfectly handled right now, but serves as &quot;meat&quot; for further work. Simply adding such meat should be discouraged (noone wants to eat raw meat, unless it's sliced thinly and very expensive), but not forbidden, because not everyone has the time or skill to be a Michelin chef, but if they just bagged a plump waterfowl, they should be encouraged to bring it into the kitchen.</text>

==Trend==
A trend I am observing on Wikipedia is excessive paranoia about copyright infringements. While a certain amount of preventive action is certainly necessary, I strongly oppose simply deleting an entry for &quot;presumed&quot; copyright violations.

Examples:
* An entry which contains a few copied phrases from individual websites or other sources. Quotation, even without attribution, is specifically allowed in international copyright law, and single sentences are generally not protectable.
* A digitized picture that may be copied from elsewhere, but has in fact been created hundreds of years ago. Sometimes, the companies who have digitized these pictures [[w:Copyright commandeering|claim copyright on them]], but I find such claims highly dubious.
* Screenshots of free software applications, and small illustrative screenshots. It should generally be no problem if a screenshot is copied from the official product page.

These are cases where I would generally not delete the entry unless the alleged copyright holder complains. Given Wikipedia's potential liability, after a complaint, immediate action may be necessary, although later correction is possible. But it is not Wikipedians' job to excessively &quot;police&quot; content for copyright infringements, especially when such may not even exist.

In general, when in doubt, do not delete. When &quot;fairly certain&quot;, &lt;I&gt;ask&lt;/I&gt; the author first in /Talk. The notion of &quot;intellectual property&quot; is dubious at best, (see: [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html RMS on IP] and [http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html The Geneva Declaration], etc.) and Wikipedia should not support it beyond the limits given by law. Personally, I will restore any entries which I do not see as copyright infringements, and I encourage you to do the same. 

-- [[w:User:Eloquence]]

:&quot;Quotation, even without attribution, is specifically allowed in international copyright law, and single sentences are generally not protectable.&quot;  Not protectable, but taking sentences verbatim, or lengthy unattributed paraphrase, is for better or for worse considered academic dishonesty of the first degree and often punished with the academic equivalent of the death penalty.  While I don't think we should delete entire articles that such material is inserted into, it would be extremely bad for the project's credibility to tolerate these to remain.  --[[w:User:NTK]]

::Oh, come on! That is ridiculous. From whence any wikimedia project has to abide by some unwritten, subjective and largely invisible code of &quot;academic etiquette&quot;? What is the law is the law and what is not the law is not the law.
----
There's no &quot;trend&quot;: we've ''always'' been &quot;paranoid&quot; about copyright infringement, and I like it that way, personally!  :-)

:Being paranoid over something is hardly ever good, and it is not good in this case.  Fair Use currently exists, and until it *is* finally destroyed I suggest we make full use of the rights we have under it.

:Worst case scenario: A copyright holder says we are going beyond the bounds of fair use, and then we review it and decide to fight it or take it down.  To deny the benefits of the additional information and contributions fair use allows because of a mere possibility of being asked to remove it later is asinine.--[[User:ShaunMacPherson|ShaunMacPherson]] 08:52, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Copyright infringements put Wikipedia's owners and the project itself at some risk.  That's why we care.  What if, in a few years, a dozen different websites and paper encyclopedia publishers had editions of Wikipedia--and all of them had copies of some copyrighted article.  What if the copyright holder wanted to make a bunch of money on the case?  Basically, we want to avoid even having to deal with that, even if it could be dealt with amicably.

You might not realize it, but copyright infringment was a regular, if not significant, problem in the months before you arrived.  On a fairly regular basis--a few times a week, perhaps--someone would simply copy large amounts of copyrighted text into Wikipedia.  We'd catch it and remove it.  I think this doesn't happen quite as often anymore, for whatever reason (maybe we aren't catching it enough :-( ).

:I hope you realize that fair use is something very different and apart from copyright infringement.  Copying whole articles is a no-no, using pictures, quotations, and a whole list of other things is permitted.  It is 'paranoia' when we do not avail ourselves of the fair use rights we have out of irrational fear. --[[User:ShaunMacPherson|ShaunMacPherson]] 08:52, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Now, if your main point is that we should ''always'' ask someone first before removing an article, I would counter that this is both a matter of context and a matter of taste, not something on which we need a strict policy.  ''For instance, if I see that so-and-so has uploaded an article from a webpage that has a clear copyright notice on it, and it's clear that so-and-so is not the author of that text, I feel no regrets about simply deleting the text from Wikipedia.''  Others might follow other policies.  Generally, I feel that there is enough abundance of content for Wikipedia that it is probably better to err on the side of deleting.  If it is pretty clear that we are violating someone's copyright by having their content on Wikipedia, delete the text--but explain on the /Talk page, ''always,'' in any case!  If it's not so clear, but it does appear to be a copyright violation, then ask on the /Talk page; if no reply, delete.  Those are my rules of thumb.

Finally, Wikipedia does not have an official policy about the propriety of the institution of intellectual property.  We should not attempt to advocate a policy whereby we try to impose on other Wikipedians the view that intellectual property is wrong.  So, if the decision to delete or not to delete comes down to whether one respects intellectual property (I can't imagine, but just suppose), then kindly allow those of us who might happen to believe that there should be such a thing as intellectual property to act according to our own principles. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

:Those who take Larry Sanger's approach (as described in the sentence above, which I've ''italicized'') are wrong to do so.  They are wrong because [[W:Copyfraud]] crimes (false claims of copyright made in a fraudulent attempt to control works) are rampant.  Just because User X has uploaded an article, image or other content from a webpage that has a clear copyright notice on it, and it's clear that User X is not the author of that text, it is still NOT appropriate to delete the content MERELY on that basis; further information MUST be found.
:There are many cases where the law is very clear cut, and it's entirely clear; consider the common case in Florida, where [[W:Template:PD-FLGov]] makes clear, in a well-documented manner, that copyright claims such as the one made [http://library.ucf.edu/GovDocs/gis.asp here], and on many other sites providing Florida public record GIS data, are legally unsupportable (it reads: ''&quot;... the raw data cannot be downloaded due to copyright restrictions. NOTE: &quot;The FGDL data as provided by contributing organizations and any programming software created by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center (collectively the &quot;materials&quot;) are copyrighted by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center for the FGDL contributing agencies and organizations (the &quot;data providers&quot;).&quot; You may not reproduce, redistribute or resell the materials, or provide the materials for free to customers or clients, or place the materials for download on a website. Additionally, when using FGDL data or software in projects, maps, etc.; you must acknowledge the FGDL as a data source.''
:''Each student enrolled in a GIS or other course at UCF who requires sample data from the FGDL for a single Florida county should purchase a County CD-ROM for that county (currently $20) for the student's personal use as part of course materials.&quot;'').  
:The Microdecisions case PD-FLGov cites is about the exact same kind of data: Florida Government-created GIS data, and makes plain that the copyright notice excerpted above is &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;expletive&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;!-- more at http://www.fgdl.org/forms/agreedot.html --&gt;  (FYI, it is also well established that Florida Government-created software is also not copyrightable; see 2006-217go.pdf for this.)  &quot;Copyright paranoia&quot; most certainly does exist at Wikimedia projects.  Increasingly so.  Frequent blatant copyright infringement is no excuse for Copyright Paranoia.--[[User:Elvey|Elvey]] 19:24, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

----
Personally, I highly doubt the value of intellectual property law. However, I remove all clear copyright violations with extreme prejudice. If Wikipedia content were to stay solely on the wiki, I would happily support a  &quot;wait for the challenge&quot; policy, since it is trivial to add and remove content in this medium. However, Wikipedia will probably be distributed in other forms (multimedia CD, el-cheapo paperback edition, etc) and we could get in a whole heap of trouble if copyrighted material slips into those. We need to catch it as soon as we can, so that those good guys at [[w:Bomis]] aren't bled dry in legal battles. --[[STG]]
----
Wholesale copying should be discouraged, but there won't be any harmful consequences for Wikipedia if action is only taken in response to complaint. In other words, if individuals want to be vigilant, that's fine, but there's no need to encourage people to be so. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
1) Trend: Yes, maybe you're right, Larry -- I noticed that the removal of &quot;violations&quot; seemed to happen in &quot;bursts&quot; at least, perhaps because certain individuals are especially motivated to go after presumed violators.

2) You always have to live with the risk of a lawsuit that has no merit. For example, what if an entry about Shell Oil contains information about their murderous practices in Nigeria that Shell Oil doesn't like? Should we remove it preventively to avoid a lawsuit from Shell Oil, which could get quite expensive? What if a company interprets a Wikipedia title as a trademark violation because our entry ranks higher in the search engine than theirs (such cases already exist)? Should we preventively move all company names to subpages? If you want to be safe from the risk of a lawsuit, running an encyclopedia which anyone can edit is probably not such a good idea ;-)

More generally speaking, while we can find evidence that an entry &lt;I&gt;is&lt;/I&gt; copied from somewhere else, we can never say with certainty that it is &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt;. If this general uncertainty is just as big as the &quot;certainty&quot; that a certain entry violates copyright, or other laws, then the entry should not be deleted, because consequently this would mean that everything except what you have written yourself needs to be deleted.

I agree with you that people should be able to make decisions on the basis of their beliefs about intellectual property -- what I wrote is only a police recommendation that nobody has to heed. Unfortunately, that is not true for the edit notice that I am currently seeing below my textarea, which in bold upper case letters states:

'''DO NOT USE COPYRIGHTED WORK WITHOUT PERMISSION!'''

As is, this statement and the preceding one disallows even quotes from copyrighted material, i.e. it is more restrictive than actual law. Also, it may be not clear what &quot;USE&quot; means in this context. What if I take an entry from an encyclopedia and extract some meaningful information from it for an entry, perhaps only slightly rewor ding it? Usually, this is completely legal, as copyright only protects form, not content. 

Unlike other texts, this is not a text that I can edit, and it is clearly a recommendation from the makers of Wikipedia, so it is Wikipedia/Bomis that is not allowing people who do not believe in intellectual property to act according to their beliefs. Not that I am criticizing that, but it's the exact opposite of your last sentence. I run a few websites myself and of course do not allow people to post copyrighted content either. However, in the context of Wikipedia, it may make more sense to link to an article that explains several standards of inappropriate content, i.e. a &quot;lenient&quot; and more &quot;restrictive&quot; standard, and lets users choose which one to use when posting or deleting content. This article could serve as a stub for the &quot;lenient&quot; policy.

Which would not allow posting copyrighted works verbatim, either, of course, but recommend different behavior for different rules of &quot;certainty&quot;. -- [[w:Eloquence]]

----
I agree that the ''statement'' is a bit harsh, but I think it's pretty clear (from earlier discussions of the topic and more detailed statements on policy pages) that actual ''policy'' of Wikipedia is simply to comply with the law.  If the statement is more restrictive than that, consider it an error on the side of caution.  --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]

----

I think another concern you should have is theft of Wikipedia copyright. Due to the nature of the articles on Wikipedia--very general and generic prose written to avoid idiosyncracies specific to Wikipedia--and due to [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?KeptPages MeatBall:KeptPages]' forgive and forget policy, it's possible for someone to take a copy of a page today, wait some mo nths, run the system maintenance (or wait for someone at Bomis to do this even though this rarely happens), claim original copyright, and then sue Wikipedia for &quot;stealing&quot; the material. 

The alternative is to keep every version, every flamewar, every mistake, and ''every liability.'' That is, if someone libels today, and you version everything, that libel will be recorded forever. Then you get into deleting individual versions, and that's another major problem. Who has the power to do this? Do you trust the administrators? I don't trust myself which is why [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?PageDeletion MeatBall:PageDeletion] is not an administrator action, but a communal one. I don't have answers to this problem, unfortunately, but maybe someone else can think of one. Whatever you do, avoid Cliff's old [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?KeptVersions MeatBall:KeptVersions] idea. The key to scalability is [http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ForgiveAndForget MeatBall:ForgiveAndForget]. -- SunirShah

:I think ''real'' deletions will be rare, and affect only empty pages with stupid titles or the like. Otherwise, the very script that is generating this page keeps ''all'' article versions. Of course, being SQL-based, a database dump can be easily made before removing very old versions. --[[Magnus Manske]]

Urg, that &quot;wait till the old version is gone and claim copyright theft&quot; bit is nasty... and entirely possible. That's something we need to deal with. --[[w:Stephen Gilbert]]

One soultion is to have Wikipedia released once every year, or every two years, in a hard form (i.e. CD) so it is preserved forever and can be used to verify bogus claims.

:''Alternatively, Web Archive should be allowed to archive the site. It appears it is currently blocked via ''''robots.txt''''''.

As an additional bonus, the sale of CDs could fund Wikipedia as well as allow people (millions of people) without internet have access to the encyclopdia. --[[User:ShaunMacPherson|ShaunMacPherson]] 09:04, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

----
I'm not exactly sure what the &quot;KeptVersions&quot; idea is; it seems to be frozen pages or somesuch. I don't think it's a good idea either. 

However, the ForgiveAndForget idea is a point I largely disagree with Sunir on, while I agree with most of his/MeatBall's concepts. At least for me, the usefulness of a full revision history of Wikipedia entries drastically outweighs the negative consequences. I believe in forgiveness, but I'm not sure I see the benefit in forgetting. Already it's been a source of annoyance that on the main site the revision history only goes back about a month--I can't remember what changes/additions I made. I like to be able to pick up on entries right where I left off, be it an hour or two months, and a complete revision history helps. Also, sometimes earlier versions of entries take an alternate (but not inferior) approach to the subject, the coexistence of all the early versions create a more comprehensive entry than the fixed page itself. I'm a ForgiveAndRemember fan. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]] 

Would y ou want all your disputes with Larry remembered and reiterated to you monthly for the next several years? As wikis always exist in the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNow Wiki:WikiNow], flame wars are often continuously reignited unless their context is allowed to be removed. Full version history prevents this. 

By the way, it shouldn't surprise you that ahimsa teaches forgive and forget. If you believe in [[WikipediAhimsa]], you believe in building forgive and forget into the architecture of Wikipedia. -- S unirShah
----
:&lt;&lt; Copyright infringements put Wikipedia's owners and the project itself at some risk.  That's why we care.  What if, in a few years, a dozen different websites and paper encyclopedia publishers had editions of Wikipedia--and all of them ha d copies of some copyrighted article.  What if the copyright holder wanted to make a bunch of money on the case?  Basically, we want to avoid even having to deal with that, even if it could be dealt with amicably.&gt;&gt;

This &quot;floodgates of litigation&quot; argument is extremely fallacious.  To wit, only the most litigious of individuals would prosecute an unwitting infringement of copyright, as an affirmative defense of &amp;quot;innocent infringement&quot; would defeat any claim of damages. Moreover, it is incumbent upon anyone who uses Wikipedia content to make a reasonable review of that content, and (by necessity) that review would include a competent investigation into potential infringement of copyrights.  This is the same standard which Wikipedia should impose upon itself.

As I see it, the primary justification for paranoia about copyright infringement should not be concerns of legal liability; it should be quality control.  The only person who *might* be held accountable for copyright infringement is someone who intentionally steals the work of others and/or refuses to remedy clear cases of infringement by others.

:&lt;&lt; I think another concern you should have is theft of Wikipedia copyright. &gt;&gt;

Assuming that Wikipedia spends $30 to register its copyrighted material every three months (as most publishers of periodic materials do), this is not a valid concern.--[[user:netesq|NetEsq]]

:&quot;Wikipedia&quot; is not yet an entity capable of claiming or owning copyrights at the moment, but we're working on it.  When the paperwork is done, we will then assert collection copyrights (though individual contributions will remain with authors as they are now, licensed to us under the GFDL).  But that's not my concern at all. I am an IP skeptic as well, but as such I tend to scrupulously follow existing law for the sake of personal credibility--i.e., so I can't be accused of opposing IP law just so I can satisfy my own desires to use copyrighted material).  But even so, I agree that some people here are overly paranoid.  ''Obvious'' violations can certainly be deleted; especially since they can be recovered if we make a big mistake.  But otherwise, I agree that asking the question first is OK--we have plenty of means to do that now.  --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]

----

An alternative viewpoint: Trying to keep Wikipedia relatively clear of copyright violations isn't something I try to do out of fear of legal action - it's something I do for '''quality control'''. I try to replace fair use photos with GFDL photos fo r the same reasons I try to replace misspellings with correct spellings. [[User:MyRedDice|MyRedDice]]

----

I'm really saddened to see this article. The fuzzy thinking -- &quot;We won't get caught, it's not that big a deal&quot; -- is sloppy and unprofessional. Or, unamateur, to be more specific.

Making an Open Content work is an effort ''intrinsically connected'' to copyright and copyright law. Whatever our beliefs regarding Open Content -- for, against, indifferent -- making a quality Open Content work is Wikipedia's '''stated goal'''.

If we make a piece of work rife with copyright violations, we will not only have failed in our own effort. We will have hurt the idea of Open Content in general. It will be perfect ammunition for those who detract from the idea: &quot;See? I ''told'' you they couldn't do it! They had to ''steal'' all these images, texts, etc. from '''copyrighted''' work!&quot; What will we say then? &quot;We didn't think we'd get caught&quot;? &quot;Nobody's sued us yet&quot;? &quot;Intellectual property is dumb&quot;?

We _can_ do th is the right way, and trying to finesse copyright law in order to do it is only going to bite us in the end. '''When in doubt, leave it out.''' There's no single picture of Eminem or tasty bit of email jokery that's worth jeopardizing the integrity of Wikipedia.

Let's be paranoid because we're proud of what we do, not because we're afraid of any punishment. -- [[NotYetAUser:EvanProdromou]]

: Open content is not an end in itself. It is a means to provide free information. If there was no &quot;intellectual property&quot; law, much of our work would be redundant. Where existing laws, or reasonable interpretations thereof, allow us to use existing materials, not only should we do so in our own interest, we should also do so to defend the rights of others. For example, if Wikipedia decides that fair use of quotations or images is entirely unacceptable, ''this'' sets a precedent for others to point to in order to reason that said legal exceptions to copyright law are indeed unnecessary. Similarly, if we decide that photos of 15th century art are copyrighted and should not be used, this sets a precedent for those who seek to pirate public domain art to point to and say &quot;Look, Wikipedia respects our copyright. They can build an encyclopedia without having to steal our intelectual property. So we're going to prevent ''you'' from copying our repro of Van Gogh as well.&quot;

: Paranoia is bad because it supports the existing intellectual property regime in all its perverted variants. Certainly we should not endorse a laissez-faire attitude vis-a-vis copyright violations; however, we should be liberal in our interpretations of what we are allowed to do, and certainly not take any and every copyright claim at face value. Our projects provide a framework and reference for others who will ask themselves similar questions, and we should not contribute to further tightening the noose that copyright has become. --[[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]] 03:29 21 Jul 2003 (UTC)

To clarify 1(?) above.  Some individual sentences can be copyrighted, and have been upheld in courts.  A primary example of this is Ashleigh Brilliant's stuff, he uses copyright as a gotcha and profit driver.  However he does get away with it because the sentences are almost purely expressive.  Facts (mostly) can't be copyrighted.  So if you cut something purely to the bone; time, date, place, well-chosen words to describe action, you can be fine.  This is of course under attack by complation databases, etc.  And the biggest thing that we have to watch out for is grabbing lists.  Traditionally such things have been salted with false information to prove that someone has grabbed information from your lists.  This has included false articles in encyclopedias.  No-one would normally look up something that doesn't exists, but it does lead to interesting problems for people who like to browse for their information.&lt;br&gt;

A plea for clear copyrights

Wikipedia has done an amazing job so far.  There are thousands of excellent articles, and many, many more in the making.  Its a wonderful resource, and it has basically been created in a free and open matter.

I have seen a lot of discussion about copyright, specifically the issues arising from using other people's copyrighted work on Wikipedia.  While this is a great thing when the other work is public domain or GFDL compatible, it is, in my opinion, a very problematic issue otherwise.

People have argued that using an image as fair use is acceptable.  While it may very well be legally OK to put in image into Wikipedia claiming fair use, I feel that doing so makes Wikipedia a less valuable resource.  Now before I can use an image, I have to search around on the page, and its talk page, to make sure it is actually GFDL'ed.  Even if it doesn't say &quot;Image x not GFDL, used under fair use exception&quot;, it may still be.  (I think.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I feel *everything* that's not GFDL should be explicitly tagged as such.  If it is, great.)

Its not enough to say &quot;Wikipedia is an educational and non-profit organization, so we can use these images/texts/etc&quot;.  As many others have pointed out, Wikipedia is under the GFDL, and there is nothing that prohibits for-profit, or non-educational, use in that license.  So, IMO, anything in Wikipedia should be under the GFDL.

What about the images that are only available in non-GFDL form, such as some famous photographs?   My suggestion is that in those cases, we should make a link to sites which have those photos (or other resources).  We could link to archive.org's Wayback Machine as a backup in case the original site goes down.

As Wikipedia becomes more and more popular, this is becoming a bigger issue.  If there was one lawsuit against Wikipedia, e.g. for some images posted w/o permission, we would get a bunch of negative publicity.  I know this is an unlikely scenario, but think about this issue.  Wikipedia should be the &quot;encyclopedia-on-the-hill&quot;, in the glass house, setting the example of good-copyright-citizenship.  Otherwise, any attempt to prevent illegal use of Wikipedia content would seem rather out of place.

:Waiving our fair use rights is the first step before they taken away for good.  I think fair use should be actively *encouraged*, and it is a waste of your time, and is damaging for those who fight for fair use, lesses the value of the article to take away contributing content, to delete peoples' contributed images that are legally permitted by fair use.--[[User:ShaunMacPherson|ShaunMacPherson]] 09:18, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I am sorry if I came off harshly in this &quot;plea&quot;; I realize the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is completely legal.  I would like to keep that, and ensure that non-free content doesn't leak into it somehow.  I would rather see a thousand new entries on the Requested Images page than one image in Wikipedia that shouldn't be here. (And yes, in a few weeks, I'll be doing my best to fill some of those requests.)  Comments appreciated.

: While it's not impossible to sue the Wikipedia, the reaction if it happened would be a small version of the SCO mess for any company doing it. There's merit in making full use of the copyright law in each jurisdiction, provided we make it easy to get whatever subset is required for a particular publication. We don't yet do that but we are heading that way. Agree about the notice for the image at the place it is used (in the article). That's the way to maximise hte wiki tendency to rework stubs and get it really working hard on replacing images with the most free version possible.

Agreed. Yes, being aware of non-US issues matters, particularly the way even a restrictive license can be easier to use than fair use in some jurisdictions, but some discussions are going much further than is necessary.

'''There seems to be an argument that has been overlooked (or perhaps I overlooked the argument on this web page): every copyright owner who sees his work used here without his consent, can be bold and remove the work in question.

I have no idea about the legal aspects of this, but I believe it should be considered. Secondly, if the problem is with a picture, you've got to be an admin to delete it. From an article, sure, you could remove the link to it but I'm afraid that's not enough. On the other hand, we could add a link at the bottom of every page: &quot;What to do if content of this page is a copyright infringement&quot; with an suitable &quot;to do-list&quot; for copyright owners. Personally, I could be accused of copyright paranoia, but I do believe that such a link could protect us pretty well...

== Beware reproduction fees ==

Wikipedians should also beware that while an image might be out of copyright, the library which provides you with the copy will often charge a hefty fee to allow it to be placed on a web-site or any other publication. This can mean that it might not be economically viable to make use of an image. I think that having an artist redraw it might be legal. Many web library web sites have images with a very low resolution so they cannot be reproduced, only read on screen. To get a usable copy costs, I am afraid. [[User:Apwoolrich|Apwoolrich]] 14:42, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: In the US, there is no legal reason enforcing a reproduction fee. If you sign a contract before copying, then they have a contract agreement with you but not Wikipedia. The same rules about contracts apply here as everywhere; read before you sign and know what you're signing. --[[User:65.64.75.239|65.64.75.239]] 02:55, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

::Actually, you wouldn't necessarily even have to sign a contract.  Nothing in the [[w:statute of frauds]] for most jurisdictions that I know of would bar enforcement of oral or unsigned contracts in the case of copying fees, so any action indicating agreement to such an arrangements could be enforceable.  It is possible that even something like a visible sign saying &quot;by copying X you agree to abide by our copying policy Y&quot; would be considered a valid offer, and by taking and copying the image you would be accepting.  (Of course all this would need to be proven.) However you are correct that in any event, the resultant copy would still be public domain and Wikipedia, as a non-party to the contract, would be free to use it without fear of punishment.  Not so the copier.   --[[w:User:NTK]]

:I don't get this copy fee. I understand the library charges you a fee to pay for their staffs time and the use of their copy machine or digita camera, printer etc. but once you pay for that service I would think you could then make your own copies as much as possible because the work is no longer under copyright. They cannot charge you a fee to use the item on a web site. They can only charge you a fee for access to the original. --[[User:24.94.189.11|24.94.189.11]] 19:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

==Copyright question re [[Beasts of England]] from [[Animal Farm]]==

There is a discussion in progress at [[Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Beasts_of_England]] regarding an article which consists&amp;mdash;correction, formerly consisted&amp;mdash;mostly of the complete seven stanzas of [[Beasts of England]], from [[Animal Farm]]. I believe there is at least a question about the copyright's status. And I do believe that whomever inserted the line in the article saying:
:''Note: Lyrics are [[public domain]], under 50-year death expiration.  see [[copyrights]]''
is oversimplifying. 
I'd appreciate it knowledgeable commentary about this in the VfD discussion, near the bottom (where I've put a longish comment). My guess is that maybe it's OK, but ''not'' because it's in the public domain. I don't believe it is in the public domain in the U.S. My reason for believing this is that the UPenn Online Books Page says it isn't. 
I don't say we can't use it. I say if we can we need a clear rationale, and &quot;50-year death expiration&quot; ain't it. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 20:34, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Japanese Wikipedia has been considering both the U.S. and Japanese laws. I wrote some explanations at here:[[User:Tomos/Legal discussions on Japanese Wikipedia]].

The &quot;NET&quot; Act and U.S. Copyright Laws cover U.S. copyrighted publications '''only'''. This covers any text translated into '''any''' language: if the original text was still published in the U.S. (it also applies for U.S. servers), it is unlawful to plagiarize it (the subject is able to be prosecuted under International Copyright Laws and/or under the U.S. justice system). Period. --[[User:72.193.35.140|72.193.35.140]] 06:08, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;the subject is able to be prosecuted under International Copyright Laws and/or under the U.S. justice system&quot; Let us be more accurate here, no prosecution under US law can take place outside the United States. There are many cited cases where an infringer of DMCA and other similar restrictive US laws have only been successfully prosecuted after they travelled to the United States on other matters and were seized whilst there. --[[User:84.12.67.77|84.12.67.77]] 21:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

==Nobody leaves this universe alive==

If my respected colleagues will excuse me, I think a great deal of discussion on this topic (here and elsewhere) tries to oversimplify the problem. Battles over copyright law rage daily in courts all over the world, especially here in the litigious USA. Being sued, or otherwise hassled, for copyright infringement is a ''known risk'' of publication which increases as the size, scope, and variety of the published work increases. And work created in a vaccuum is without merit. 

Both extreme positions are too simple: 

* ''Let's just make our own original stuff always and be safe.'' 

* ''Let's use everything that might possibly fall under fair use and put the burden of action on'' '''''their''''' ''shoulders.''

Writing for publication without plagiarism is a skill taught in universities; there are thousands -- millions -- of limits, qualifications, exceptions, and matters of mature judgement involved. And not even men of goodwill always agree. By throwing open the doors to editors of all backgrounds, Wikipedia is truly going out on a limb, since most editors will not have any grasp of these subtleties. But the benefits outweigh the risks. We amend those risks by self-policing, and nothing will take the place of a great deal of time spent reviewing each other's work. 

I think there is little point in debating policy in this. The Old Heads among us know (or at least guess at) fair use and infringement when they see them, and the best guide to whether a paragraph or image is acceptable is the group consensus. --[[User:Xiong|Xiong]] 23:51, 2005 Mar 13 (UTC)

Yes, but with respect, the &quot;older heads&quot; do not necessarily know &quot;fair dealing&quot; or countless other exceptions to copyright law. We do not all live in the United States. I for one am bound by my religion, my system of morals and professional obligations to try not to break the laws of copyright in my jurisdiction (that's why I watch videoed TV once).

==License contamination==

One of the more insidious issues why copyright paranoid is needed is license contamination - essentially, if anything thats not public domain or GFDL is present, it contaminates the work as a whole - this complicates some long term goals such as print versions.

Fair use is exceptionally limited in scope, and its a grey area with only a few tested cases. Even the cases that have been tested have shown that there are many variables. Downstream users of our project's data may be at risk, especially if they are comercial users, even if they try to adhere to our license agreement (GFDL). In short, &quot;fair use&quot; is like planting milefields in the middle of our otherwise free-to-use materials.

While I'm not oppossed to limited cases of fair use, we do need to understand that it comes with heavy risks and a heavy price - the need to make sure that where we claim fair use, we claim it legitimately, and use items claimed as fair use only in an intended manner. It also means that we MUST track these items carefully to ensure that they are not used inappropriately within our project and that downstream users know they are there and how to exclude them where appropriate.

Given this, and the need for Wikimedia to hold the moral and legal high ground we need policies that are stronger than that which are provided by copyright law and by strict interpetations of fair use, so that we avoid *ANY* unneccessary and/or inappropriate use of fair use materials.

In short, copyright paranoia is generally a good thing.
:If you want copyright paranoia, try the [[:en:Free Software Foundation]].  Every contribution to the FSF codebase has to be accompanied by a signed piece of paper certifying the contrib is not a copyvio, accepting responsibility if it is one, and (for larger contributions) assigning the copyright to the FSF so they can enforce the GPL.  If you're employed somewhere when you write the contributed work, you have to get an officer of your company to sign a piece of paper too.  At the other end of the spectrum is a company like the original Napster, which pushed the envelope to the breaking point and went down in flames.  In the middle is someplace like Google, which is somewhat aggressive (the Google Books feature, the Google cache, etc.) but has lots of lawyers to defend itself with, and accepts that it might win some and lose some.  

:Wikipedia has fewer lawyers than Google and therefore has to be a little more conservative on practical grounds; but if it was like the FSF, it couldn't possibly operate.  So it should be more conservative than Google, but not by more than it needs to stay out of trouble.  It could look to the example of archive.org for some guidance, if that helps.  And as it becomes a more powerful cultural force (which it already is to some extent), it should look towards asserting itself more, not less.&lt;p&gt; I agree with 71.48.59.67 that &quot;conditioning many users toward a view of copyright that is every media corporation's wet-dream&quot; is not a good thing, even if it results from things we find ourselves forced into doing for the time being.

==Fair Use dies on the vine==

It isn't Wikipedia's mission to keep fair use alive. It is within Wikipedia's mission to keep Wikipedia alive.

Nevertheless, there's altogether too much anti-&quot;fair use&quot; rhetoric thrown around in the effort to keep Wiki secure. 

&quot;Copyright paranoia&quot; is generally a bad thing -- a ''very'' bad thing, which causes us to voluntarily abandon our fair use rights before they are even legislated or adjudicated away from us. In the very narrow realm of the wiki, copyright paranoia is mostly a good thing that is, very unfortunately, conditioning many users toward a view of copyright that is every media corporation's wet-dream.

:I agree entirely. I wish certain admins would use some common sense. IMHO wikipedia is an obvious example of where fair use would most apply. Its a not for profit. Its available to all (quite literally) it has a research and educational mission, and it does not seek to compete with most other media. It's the epitome of when fair use '''should''' apply.

And what's the biggest joke of it &quot;becoming a problem&quot;?  Simple: any of us can &quot;erase&quot; the problem material in a few keystrokes.

A lot of people, including me think it's better to be a little paranoid to avoid the numerous problems that may occur it the numerous jurisdictions that we may eventually be involved in by ensuring we are very strict with copyrights rather then just hoping that a problem won't arise and hoping it'll be easy to fix and won't waste a lot of our existing work when we have to fix it [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 12:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

: Yes, sometimes people need to chill, but copyright law is what it is, not because of what the general public wants it to be, but because of what the legislatures and courts say it is. &quot;Fair use&quot; is defined in the law. You can skate around those definitions all you want, saying, &quot;Well, ''I'' think it's fair for me to copy it, because I'm not getting paid,&quot; but it would be extremely unwise to let Wikipedia fill itself up with tons of little copyright infringements waiting to ripen into big class action lawsuits. There's a line between being prudent and being paranoid. Maybe Bobak can spend a little effort clarifying for us little folks just what fair use is. Infringing uses are easy to see? Not so, dude. Not if everyone is operating under different concepts of what the line is between fair use and infringement. I took all those courses in law school, too, and they were a good start at understanding the issues, but nothing more than a good start. I practiced law for 18 years, including plenty of active litigation, and sometimes dealt with IP issues. That's education in the real world; I'm not just shooting off my mouth. Sure, Bobak, as a practical matter, nobody is going to pay a lawyer $5,000 to get a $10 royalty, but if Wikipedia has 10,000 $10 infringements ... you get the picture?

==nice going==
I agree with the person who wrote this. Wikipedians don't need to do that, leave it to the authorative people to handle copyright problems. I see copyright paranoia as a roadblock to the success of Wikipedia. Images generally attract people's attention and without them, well thats too bad for Wikipedia.

==Possible compromise For restrictions of Images of living people ==


Granted I understand that the foundation wants free use maximized. (Note: some fair use is widely used so that part of wikipedia is already unusable for commercial 3rd parties, unless they too claim fair use. They might be able to.) However sometimes when there is a living person this policy results in no photo at all. So I suggest a '''middle ground'''. 

eg: Bill is looking for pic of person X. Let us assume that except for issue of X being alive all other fair use criteria are met. Also assume that its not a pic of a specific event etc.

*1. Bill looks for pic of person and doesn't find public domain.
*2. Bill issues public call for public domain pic of X.
*3. Bill waits 30 days. If PD found then use it, if not continue to 4.
*4. Bill performs another look himself and documents it and issues final call.
*5. Other users now check bill's documentation to make sure its legit during another 30 day waiting period. Users again look for PD pic. If legit and no PD pic found continue to 6.
*6. At end of second 30 day waiting period, Bill can use copyrighted pic under fair use.


This process: '''a: minimizes use of copyrighted material while b: allowing copyrighted material if in reality there is currently no other alternative.''' Often to assume that a PD pic exists '''is a fiction'''. I am not saying this is always or mostly the case, but there are enough times when no PD is available. Secondly, just because someone could in the future take a pic, it may be that no pic is taken. Then the article is the worse for it. In all probability it is '''highly unlikely''' - after a public call goes out for a PD and fails -  that a pic will subsequently be released it to PD in a reasonable time. Thirdly, it may happen, but not for 25 years. Well there is no point waiting 25 years for a PD pic when we could use fair use to use a copyrighted one in the meantime.

Hahaha... &quot;I'm from Wikipedia.&quot; That's  a good one. Anyway, did you properly cite (yourself) the source using the regulations at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Image_use_policy ?

==&quot;Copyright paranoia&quot; does not exist at Wikimedia projects==
People often point to this page when they want to argue that since Wikipedia's use of a certain non-free image falls within U.S. fair-use laws, the Foundation is extremely unlikely to get sued, and for that reason we shouldn't be &quot;paranoid&quot; about using it. That completely misses the point about ''why'' Wikimedia projects avoid non-free images as much as possible. We avoid them because these projects are part of the [[w:free content|free content]] movement, which rejects the use of material protected by copyright law. Just like pacifists, who avoid violence even when it would be legally permitted (e.g. in self-defense), the free content movement avoids non-free material even when using it would be legally permitted (the &quot;fair use&quot; defense). So when someone tells you &quot;Avoid copyright paranoia&quot;, just reply &quot;There is no such thing here. We don't delete non-free content because we're afraid of getting sued. We delete non-free content because it's non-free.&quot; [[User:Angr|Angr]] 16:34, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

*I don't think that is really the spirit of policies like [[en:WP:NFCC]]. If WikiMedia projects were immune to copyright threats, I'm fairly certain that our policies wouldn't attempt to restrict ''harmless'' uses of copyrighted work, at the least. (Moral rights could still justify restrictions on uses which detriment the copyright holder, of course.) And I don't really agree that respecting copyrights is an aspiration of the free content movement &amp;mdash; if anything. (Of course, if you asked [[en:Lawrence Lessig|Lawrence Lessig]] if he thought copyrights should be acknowledged he'd likely reply &quot;yes,&quot; but that comes with any any non-radical stance on the issue of copyright standards.) Not that being part of a WikiMedia project necessitates abiding by the norms of whatever associated contemporary movements.

**Well, [[en:WP:NFCC]] isn't in the spirit of building a free-content encyclopedia anyway. And I think the free content movement is not so much about respecting copyrights as learning to live without copyrighted material. On my user page at [[en:User:Angr]] I draw a parallel between the free-content movement and veganism: both are about consciously deciding to do without something for moral reasons, even though legally one is not required to do without it. [[User:Angr|Angr]] 20:24, 28 November 2007 (UTC)
***I have to agree with what [[w:User:Jenolen|Jenolen]] says here: [[w:User:Jenolen/What Wikipedia Is Not Addition|Wikipedia is not a social movement to create free content]]; it is first and foremost an [[w:WP:ENC|encyclopedia]]. Your vegan analogy falls apart when you realize there are two ways to interpret &quot;free-content&quot;: one intepretation (yours) is content entirely free of copyrighted material not under an explicitly free license, another interpetation is content which, as a whole, is under a free-content license, but that may use some copyrighted material in ways which are legal to use (and thus for all practical purposes &quot;free&quot; in such a context). A more apt analogy might be to liken Wikipedia to a &quot;vegetarian potluck dinner&quot; for all types of vegetarians including [[w:ovolactovegetarian|ovolactovegetarian]]s, with a policy of clearly disclosing any animal products used in dishes; and then imagine a number of vegans showing up and insisting that veganism is the only proper form of vegetarianism and attempting to trash any food which contains eggs or milk, because it is &quot;not compatible with the vegetarian movement&quot;. Such people would rightly be called extremists. Note that a project like [[Wikiquote]] would not be even able to exist (beyond containing quotes which are old enough to be out of copyright) if the Wikimedia Foundation adopted a &quot;vegan&quot; interpretion of &quot;free-content&quot;. [[User:DHowell|DHowell]] 05:11, 29 November 2007 (UTC)
****It seems to me your interpretation of free-content is simply self-contradictory. (And Jenolen's vision of Wikipedia is a vegan dinner with fried chicken, beef brisket, spare ribs, and no vegetables. Did you see his userbox stating his opposition to free images?) As for Wikiquote, the vast majority of English-language authors worth quoting have been dead for more than 70 years, and the rest will have been someday. There's no reason for fair use there either, and every copyrighted quote added there takes English Wikiquote one step closer to the fate of French Wikiquote: shut down and completely deleted because of massive copyright violations. [[User:Angr|Angr]] 23:30, 29 November 2007 (UTC)
***** &quot;''The vast majority of English-language authors worth quoting have been dead for more than 70 years''&quot;? Wow, do you have a reliable source for that bit of original research? Even if it were true, there are still a great many contemporary English-language authors &quot;worth quoting&quot; and I don't think I've seen anyone, other than you, arguing that they should be eliminated from Wikiquote. As far as I am aware, the French Wikiquote fiasco had more to do with people copying quote ''collections'' from other places, running afoul of the [[w:database right|database right]]s of European Union law, than with individual quotes of contemporary authors. The current French Wikiquote still contains plenty of quotes from authors who have not been dead 70 years, as evidenced by the fact that there are categories for [[fr:q:Catégorie:Série télévisée|television series]] and [[fr:q:Catégorie:Jeu vidéo|video games]]. I don't see how my interpretation of free-content is self-contradictory, seeing that I can legally publish a work incorporating fair use, copyright that work, and license it under any license I choose, including a free-content license; the incorporation of fair use content does not make it non-free, as you are free to remove the fair use content if you don't want to include it in your derivative work, or if the definition of fair dealing in your jusrisdiction is stricter than that of fair use in mine (and this is a heck of a lot easier than removing beef broth from vegetable soup). It is the jurisdictional differences of what is &quot;fair&quot;, and the copyrights owned by parties not subject to the free-content license, which create any perceived restrictions on freedom. The fact that a picture of a naked woman licensed under a free-content license might be illegal to publish in Iran doesn't make the free-content license any less free; likewise, the fact that there are jurisdictions that might prohibit one from using non-free content in ways that are perfectly valid and legal in the U.S. doesn't make the work of a free-content licensor invoking fair use any less free. [[User:DHowell|DHowell]] 05:19, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
****** My claim was based on the simple fact that the vast majority of people have been dead more than 70 years. Anyway, none of this changes my original point, which is simply that opposition to nonfree content on Wikimedia projects has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;copyright paranoia&quot;.

****Wikipedia has always been a 'free encylopaedia' not just an encyclopaedia. There is absolutely no evidence that it was ever intended that the encylopaedia part is more important then the free part. Also, you seem to have missed the point that it was never the intention of wikipedia to be only about the website. Wikipedia was intended to be a free encylopaedia for the whole world, in whatever form it may be, not simply for the web. While fair use is allowed  under US law and given that wikipedia is hosted in the US, sufficient for the website, it is not sufficient for a big part of the world. By allowing an excessive amount of non free content, we create big problems when we, or anyone else, wants to make the content available in another form. Either the content must be excluded or the content must be re-examined under the laws of the appropriate countries. Neither of these are good options. As such, wikipedia ONLY allows non free content when it is absolutely necessary i.e. when there is no other option and it is unlikely an option can be created. Fair use content is not free and your suggestion it is suggests to me you may have a lack of understanding of free content. Either that or you have a very US centric POV since you seem to think anything which can be used freely in the US (not that fair use content can be used freely in the US) is free [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 04:39, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

==&quot;Copyright paranoia&quot; does exist at Wikimedia projects==
Sorry, Angr, but copyright paranoia exists.  Some works which people claim a copyright on, are not copyrightable.  So, is the work usable?  Is a fair-use rationale needed?  No.  The &quot;copyright&quot; needs to be ignored.  This needs to be done on a case-by-case basis, but for example, it is never a copyright infringement to upload a corporation's logo to use on a page about the corporation.  When there is no opportunity for creativity, when there is no alternative, copyright simply doesn't apply.  Wikipedia is subject to U.S. laws, and the Constitution permits free speech AS WELL as promoting the progress of useful arts.  We have the right to use a corporation's logo to make reference to the corporation.  Period.  End of sentence.  No discussion possible.  Trademarks aren't mentioned in the Constitution, so free speech overrules trademark law.  Of course, such speech needs to be truthful, but that goes without saying.

More evidence  of paranoia is the advice against uploading a high resolution copyrighted image.  If the work is widely available, and anybody can scan it, and the image is being used in a way which does not violate copyright (see previous paragraph), then the resolution of the scan does not matter.  [[User:RussNelson|RussNelson]] 02:19, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
:But who said we should only ever consider US law? Wikipedia the website is subject to US law, but we have never wanted to only be a website hosted in the US. We aim for free content, content which is likely to be free in nearly all countries of the world. If the content is not free, then we need to consider carefully whether it should be allowed and NFCC is that. It's not paranoid to recognise free content is not free content if it is only 'free' in the US. Also, legal issues are primarily for our lawyer to sort out anyway. Most of the time, we don't consider legal issues because our policies are intentially much more restrictive. Why else do you think we don't allow content with permission if it is not free except under NFCC? [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 04:44, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

==How to diagnose copyright paranoia==
Copyright paranoia, like many unhealthy behavioral problems, can develop gradually and be difficult to self-diagnose.  If you suspect that you or an editor that you have come in contact may be suffering from copyright paranoia, check for these common symptoms:

*'''The What-if Syndrome''':  Excessive and irrational use of what-if scenarios is one common sign of copyright paranoia.  
** example 1) &quot;What if some small pieces of copyrighted material slip into Wikipedia and then what if, in the distant future someone decides to publish hardcopies of a version of Wikipedia in third world countries and the books are seized at the border?&quot;
** example 2) &quot;What if an editor uses a piece of copyrighted material and then it gets modified over and over by other editors until it is unrecognizable but then what-if the copyright owner finds out by tracing the version history and what if he decides to file a lawsuit?&quot;

*'''The but-we-just-don't-know-for-sure syndrome''':  One suffering from copyright paranoia suspects copyright infringement is lurking around every article and talk page.  They will not accept rational arguments about whether a claim of copyright by a source is invalid because it is an exact duplicate of an expired or non-copyright eligible work.   When any room for doubt exists in the copyright status or acceptable use of a particular article, those suffering from copyright paranoia will become overwhelmed with a self delusional fear of ill-defined, future consequences and lash out in self defense by deleting the material without first engaging in discussion.

*'''Actively seeking out suspect material''':  A healthy Wikipedian derives a sense of self satisfaction by making contributions to Wikipedia.  They may occasionally delete the rare blatant copyright violation when they come across one.  However, one that suffers from copyright paranoia will begin to actively seek out suspected copyright violations.  More and more of their edits become consumed with the unhealthy behavior of undoing others' edits, tagging pictures for deletion, or even blanking entire pages.  They will construct complex, self-reinforcing rationalizations in their mind about how the removal of so much material is actually a good thing and how this actually constitutes some type of &quot;contribution&quot; to the project.  If you find that more than ~1% of your edits are related to the destruction of content rather than content creation, you may be suffering from copyright paranoia.

* '''Denial of fair use:''' There is no such thing as &quot;Fair Use,&quot; only &quot;No Use&quot;. 

*The spanish wikipedia doesn't allow fair use material: '''La paranoia ya los ha consumido'''.

Copyright paranoia can be a difficult behavioral problem to overcome.  If you suspect that you or someone you love is suffering from copyright paranoia, you should seek out professional counseling, a support group, or just take a long wiki-break to engage in other, offline healthy activities.  Remember that there is no time limit and in the end, Wikipedia will get it right.

This page is for discussion of [[w:folklore]], [[w:religion]], and [[w:mythology]].


=== Use of the words 'Myth', 'Mythology', etc. ===Donald Bankhead

The word 'Myth' has several meanings in the English language.  Probably the best place to find out these meanings is to consult [http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=myth a dictionary].  One meaning, roughly, has it that a myth is &quot;a story that express the religion, beliefs and morals of a culture&quot; and another meaning is roughly &quot;a story that is false or made-up&quot;.  The boundary between the two meanings is unclear.

Some argue that only relatively rarely is &quot;myth&quot; used in such a way as not to imply or suggest that the stories of a culture are in any way dubious.  They argue that typically, the &quot;myth&quot; is used specifically to suggest that the stories are not to be relied upon as true, though, for all we know, they might be true. Other people disagree with this, and say that &quot;myth&quot; is frequently used ''without intending to make any judgement about the truth or falsehood of the myths,'' although sometimes the mistaken impression is given that such an intention exists.

In English, we normally reserve the terms &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;mythology&quot; for the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions (such as those of Greece or Rome), which have few or no followers today. Except in some academic and critical contexts, we generally do not call the stories of Judaism, Christianity or Islam &quot;myths&quot; or &quot;mythologies.&quot;  Many people, though maybe not all (e.g. Hegel seems to consider Christianity different because of its resemblance to &quot;philosophy&quot; and Nietzsche, especially in ''Birth of Tragedy'', seems to consider Christianity worse or more degenerate; see also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_to_avoid Words to avoid]), think that from a religiously neutral point of view the stories of these extant religions are not a fundamentally different phenomenon from those stories that we do call myths.

Seven options have been proposed so far, by various people, for using the terms 'myth', 'mythology', etc., on Wikipedia:

=== Option 1 ===

Call the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions &quot;myths&quot; or &quot;mythology&quot;; do not use this term for the stories of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or any other extant religion of any significant size.  (So we might continue to call Greek and Roman stories &quot;myths&quot; even if a tiny minority of neopagans claims to believe the stories are true.)

PROS:
*This is the usage that most people will be expecting and familiar with; some people find calling the traditional stories of extant religions &quot;myths&quot; to be jarring.
*Few people are likely to be offended by calling the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions &quot;myths&quot; or &quot;mythology&quot;; some people may be offended by the use of those terms to describe the stories of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, even if we explain to them that we are using it in a neutral sense.
*People will be expecting to find the stories of the ancient Greek and Roman religions under the name &quot;mythology.&quot;  (They won't expect to find Bible stories under &quot;Christian mythology,&quot; for example.)
CONS:
*This perpetuates bias in favour of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, against ancient polytheistic religions; perpetuating such bias would not appear to be NPOV
**Reply: this seems to me a misunderstanding of what &quot;[[neutral point of view]]&quot; means.  Writing from the NPOV means writing so as not to make the text suggest that any ''extant'' views might be any more likely than any others, or in other words, letting people make up their own minds as regards ''extant'' views.  Who cares what people believed 2500 years ago, if no one has such beliefs now?
***Reply: well, it appears to me that some modern Pagans do in fact believe in these myths. They generally don't mind calling them myths, but that is because: (a) for Pagans, the term 'myth' lacks a lot of the negative conontations that the term has for the wider community; and (b) most of them don't interpret the myths in a literal manner (though many ancient Pagans didn't interpret their myths in a literal manner either; and likewise many Christians have given non-literal interpretations to their myths.)
****Reply: show me ''evidence'' that some neopagans actually believe the old myths.  Frankly, I find the very suggestion very hard to swallow.  Of course,hellopoo is cool
*****The Findhorn community in Scotland seems to preach the literal existence of Pan. Search for Findhorn or Ogilvie Crombie.
I could always be wrong.  Moreover, I do not agree that there are any significant number of people who use &quot;myth&quot; with ''no'' connotations whatever of judgment about their veracity.  The ''point'' of using &quot;myth&quot; 
(or &quot;legend&quot;) rather than &quot;story&quot; is ''precisely'' to present a story as dubious at best.  Give us evidence, please, that the word is ''ever'' used differently (other than by you).
*****C.S. Lewis springs to mind. Look for a book of essays that bears the title ''God in the Dock'' if you want a specific reference. --[[Dan]]
*****You want evidence? Try a dictionary: &quot;a usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon&quot; (Merriam-Websters Online, myth, sense 1a). If my usage is in the dictionary, it has to be used by someone other than me? And compare that definition to &quot;story&quot; -- &quot;story&quot; is clearly a much more general term. ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' is a story, but it isn't a myth. Why? Because its not traditional, and it has never been claimed to be historical, and it does not &quot;unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon&quot;. The ''point'' of using &quot;myth&quot; rather than &quot;story&quot; is ''precisely'' to present a story which is traditional, obstensibly historical, and expresses the worldview, practices, beliefs, morality, etc., of a people.
******Reply: I'm not very impressed with your dictionary definition even as support for your case.  Just look at the definition you cite!  You seem to have missed the word &quot;ostensibly&quot;: myths are ''ostensibly'' historical, but (the implication is) they very well might not ''actually'' be historical.  Moreover, interpreting dictionary definitions is not an exact science; often, to fully understand the meaning of a word in use, you must examine ''several'' of the senses listed.  Also, you can ape me all you like re the point of myth, but that doesn't make your case any stronger: the inclusion of the word &quot;ostensible&quot; undermines your attempted cleverness.  :-)
*******The word &quot;ostensibly&quot; does not mean &quot;apparently but not really&quot;. It means simply &quot;apparently&quot;. Something can be both obstensibly true and in fact true. In order for something to be classified as a &quot;myth&quot;, it must have been claimed or presumed to be historical. It may or may not in fact be so. You may say the implication is being made, but no such implication is contained in the definition of &quot;ostensible&quot;. Yes, to fully understand the way a word is used, you must look at several senses; but a sense is a separable meaning -- when a word has multiple senses, it can (and most of the time is) used in only one or some of its senses. Finally, I admit dictionary definitions are not an exact science, but do you have any better proposal for determining what the word means, other than your own opinions or impressions?
*Calling the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions &quot;myths&quot; may be interpreted as a judgement on our part that these stories are false or ought not be believed; whatever our individual views on their truth or falsehood, it is not the job of an encyclopedia to tell people which religious tales they are to believe or disbelieve
**Reply: this seems to be another misunderstanding of the meaning of &quot;NPOV.&quot;  Since no one does, in fact, believe those old religious tales, it is '';totally uncontroversial'' to let Wikipedia say imply, by the unqualified, straightforward use of the word &quot;myth,&quot; that they're false.
***Reply: Can you be certain that not one person today believes them? And it is not &quot;totally uncontroversial&quot; to imply them to be false -- I, for one, am strongly opposed to doing so, and I'm sure several other people are as well. An encyclopedia should not be in the business of telling people which religious beliefs are true and false -- that applies both to currently popular religious beliefs, like Christianity, and no longer popular religious beliefs, like the ancient Greek and Roman religions. And an encyclopedia should treat all religions equally -- it should not imply that Christianity is more likely to be true than any other religion. Calling ancient Pagan stories myths, but refusing to call Christian stories myths, implies that Christian stories are more likely to be true or somehow more valid than Pagan stories, which is something a lot of people would disagree with doing.
****Reply: ''Sure,'' we should make sure that people who think that Christian stories are no more than myths are registered as &quot;myths&quot; ''in the opinion of people like you and me.''  I agree, that's very important to state, in some appropriate place.  But we should not ''title articles'' so as to reflect ''this view,'' when (1) there's no '''evidence''' that anyone (or any significant minority of people) still believes old Roman myths, while (2) we ''know'' that there are quite a few Biblical literalists.  Listing Bible stories as &quot;stories&quot; is the most neutral way to bill the Biblical stories, because it allows us to maintain the stories are false while some others (a very small number, granted) can maintain the stories are true.  It's ''not'' prejudicial in the ''least'' to make a distinction between ''extant'' religious stories and ''extinct'' religious stories.  It's ''insulting and biased'' to pretend that the distinction doesn't exist, though.
*****Reply: First of all, I never said they are &quot;no more than myths&quot;. I said they are myths, and that they may well be true myths. Personally, I think some of the stories are true, others are false -- but even the ones I believe to be true I would still call myths. And how is it insulting and biased to treat all religions equally, regardless of whether they are currently popular or not? If anything, I think it is insulting and biased to give the implication that some religions are more likely to be true than others. Wikipedia should remain religiously neutral, and avoid wherever possible implying any religion is more likely to be true than any other, even if that religion is currently more popular.
******With your point that you maintain the stories may be true myths, you are missing my point.  My point is that by ''using'' the word &quot;myth,&quot; ''most'' people (contrary to what you think) ''will'' understand you to mean &quot;traditional story of dubious provenance.&quot;  That's what &quot;myth&quot; ''means.''  So you can maintain all you like that you believe in true myths, but that ''doesn't'' alter the fact that when you use such phrase--without qualification--as &quot;Christian myth,&quot; you imply ''for most people'' that Wikipedia's official view is that Christian traditional stories are of dubious provenance.  ''That'' is insulting and biased.  There aren't any ancient Greeks around left to be insulted about their own religions!  You keep missing this point about the meaning of &quot;neutral&quot;: &quot;neutral&quot; does ''not'' mean &quot;taking no stand on anything at all.&quot;  If that were the case, no one could be neutral about anything.  &quot;Neutral&quot; means something closer to &quot;taking no stand on anything that is ''currently'' controversial.&quot;  Something that was neutral 2000 years ago can be quite biased today, and vice-versa.
********I'm not saying neutral means &quot;take no stand on anything at all&quot;. I am in favour though of being &quot;religiously neutral&quot;, which means taking no stand on matters of religious belief. Telling people what religious beliefs they should or shouldn't have is not the job of an encyclopedia. That includes telling people not to have religious beliefs that no one alive today has. (And, you have so far provided no evidence that no one alive today does have these beliefs -- there are plenty of neopagans out there, many of whom would say they believe the myths of some ancient civilization or another.)
*******Do you recall that the original article which started this dispute explicity qualified that the word &quot;myth&quot; was being used in a completely neutral sense, with no implication about whether the story was true or false? If we explicitly state in the article that we are using it in this way, then no reasonable person should be offended. If they are still offended, it must be because they are not reading what we have said the word &quot;myth&quot; means. So, if we provide clear and appropriate qualification as to how we will use the word myth, then no reasonable person should interpret it as any judgement on our part that the mytth is dubious. ''That'' is not insulting and not biased. 
*Using different terms for the stories of ancient polytheistic religions on the one hand, and the stories of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (to say nothing of Hinduism or Buddhism) on the other, may obscure the similarities between the two phenomena, and makes a distinction which may not have any basis in the features of the stories themselves
**Reply: the notion that there are such similarities is bound to be somewhat controversial ''for some.''  In any case, it's exceedingly obvious that the way to point out such similarities is not simply to use the word &quot;myth&quot; to describe both sets of stories, and let it go at that.  It would be to investigate and report about what research has been done on &quot;the mythology of extant religions.&quot;  Surely there's no reason to oppose formulating the point about the similarities in such a fashion?  Won't that make everyone happy?  (Still waiting for an answer to this.)
***Reply: well of course there are some very basic similarities. They all involve religious entities (gods, angels, demons, heroes, prophets, etc.), miracles, supernatural occurences. They all are used by their followers as inspiration for their religious practice. They express the religious beliefs of the people who originated them. They express moral teaching. And they all fit the definiton of myth contained in sense 1a of Merriam-Websters Online. You'd have to be blind to deny that these similarities exist. And these basic similarities can be pointed out very well by calling them &quot;myths&quot; (in sense 1a), since sense 1a of Merriam-Webster's captures reasonably well what the most fundamental similarities between them are.
****Reply: you completely missed the point.  Please re-read what I wrote.  I was not simply (or even at all) saying that there are not very basic similarities between extinct and extant religions' traditional stories.
* Presumably this option should be referring to any present-day religion, not just Judaism, Christianity or Islam?  Probably practically any &quot;myth&quot; ever invented is still believed by somebody.
** Reply: yes, it should be referring to ''any extant religion.''  What evidence do you have to believe that &quot;practically any 'myth' ever invented is still believed by somebody&quot;?  That sounds very unlikely indeed to me.
*** Reply: well, what about the stories of Hinduism? They are frequently called myths, and the whole body is often called &quot;Hindu Mythology&quot; and &quot;Indian Mythology&quot;. And in fact Hindu stories are very similar to Greek, Roman or Egyptian stories.
**** Reply: I would say that, if the vast majority of Hindus do not in fact have any problem calling them &quot;myths,&quot; with all of the baggage of that word (and I can understand how modern Hindus might indeed not have any problem with doing that)--then ''we'' might as well call them &quot;myths.&quot;  In any case, we try to be respectful of their beliefs.  Why is that so difficult?  If they ''do'' have a problem with it, then that problem is easily solved by our having a [[traditional Hindu stories]] page, with some sentences, high up in the article, explaining that the stories are usually referred to as &quot;myths&quot; in English discussions of them.
* There would be difficulties when the myths from &quot;ancient polytheistic religions&quot; have been incorporated into a present day religion, e.g., would the idea of the &quot;great flood&quot; need to be omitted from Sumerian mythology article to avoid offending somebody who didn't want it described as a myth?
** Reply: I don't see what difficulty there would be with referring to the stories of extinct religion R as &quot;myths&quot; even if there are similar stories in extant religions.  Why should anyone complain?
*** No way am I an expert, but there seems to be a great deal of reuse of old material in &quot;new&quot; religions.  If Judaism became extinct tomorrow, we'd move their bible to mythology, but guess what, somebody's still using it.  Religion R may start out with &quot;there is one all-powerful God&quot; (or whatever) and members of extant religion S may say &quot;religion R saw a small part of the truth.  why do you class it as mythology?&quot;
**** Reply: well, I think we need more data from &quot;new&quot; religions here: what do those people ''actually'' believe, and in fact are there enough of them for us to really care?  (I'm not sure how many is &quot;enough,&quot; no...)  But, yes, polite people generally do not refer to other people's religions as myth.  If you can find me a person who objects to our calling Greek, Roman, etc. myth as &quot;myth,&quot; on grounds that extant religions have some similar stories, I'll be very impressed. -- Hey, Simon, you can have the last word.  I think I have made my point as well as I can make it.

=== Option 2 ===

Call the stories of both the ancient polytheistic religions, and of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, &quot;myth&quot;. Explain clearly that we are using &quot;myth&quot; here 

PROS:
* Does not discriminate between ancient polytheistic religions, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam, nor show bias towards the latter
* Shows clearly the similarities, and allows easy comparison, between stories of the different religions, both polytheistic and monotheistic
* People will be expecting to find the stories of the ancient Greek and Roman religions under the name &quot;mythology&quot;
CONS:
* Some people may be offended by calling the Jewish, Christian and Islamic stories &quot;myth&quot;. Even if we explain that we are using &quot;myth&quot; in a neutral sense, without intending to say anything about the truth or falsehood of the stories, or the rationality of the people who believe these stories, the word &quot;myth&quot; still has connontations of falsehood in most people's minds, connontations that may be impossible to avoid

=== Option 3 ===

Avoid use of the words 'myth' and 'mythology' altogether. Refer to the stories of both groups of religions as simply 'religious stories' or some other term.

PROS:
* Does not discriminate between ancient polytheistic religions, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam, nor show bias towards the latter
* Does not suffer from any unavoidable negative connontations that the word 'myth' may have, when applied to the stories of either set of religions
CONS:
* People will be expecting the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions to be listed under 'myths'. The use of non-standard terminology may confuse people, and may make it hard for people to find what they are looking for.
* English lacks a simple, clear, and easy to use alternative to the word 'myth'. 'Religious stories' is a mouthful, and does not clearly refer to what we are talking about (many Christian novels, for instance, could be called 'Christian religious stories', but only literature like the Bible, and some other sources, is really comparable to polytheistic mythology)

=== Option 4 ===

Call the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions &quot;myths&quot; or &quot;mythology&quot;; do NOT apply the words &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;mythology&quot; to the sacred texts of modern religions; DO apply the words &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;mythology&quot; to certain relevant non-sacred stories that are linked to religious themes or traditions. For example, compare [[Christian mythology]] and [[Bible stories]].

PROS:
*Few people are likely to be offended by calling the stories of the ancient polytheistic religions &quot;myths&quot; or &quot;mythology&quot;.
*People will be expecting to find the stories of the ancient Greek and Roman religions under the name &quot;mythology&quot;.
* Does not apply negative connotations to anyone's current religious beliefs.
* Still allows consideration of non-sacred stories as myth.
CONS:
* Treats ancient religions and modern religions slightly differently.
* Some people may be offended by the implications of any word structure that puts &quot;Mythology&quot; next to &quot;Christian.&quot;

NOTE: This option is a variation on option 1 above; maybe we could we merge the two?

=== Option 5 ===

Call the stories / myths &quot;legends.&quot;  This word has almost the same denotation as the first definition of &quot;myth&quot; listed above, but does not have the negative connotation.

PROS:
*The word mostly lacks the negative qualities of &quot;myth.&quot;
CONS:
*Possible difficulty for people looking for &quot;myths,&quot; although redirects could be used.
*Although the negative conontations for this word are not as strong as for &quot;myth&quot;, it still has some negative conontations, and thus some people might still be offended if we apply it to their religion. ''Huh?  I've never heard of &quot;Legend&quot; being used in a negative way.  Ever.''
:Calling something a 'legend' or 'legendary' can also give an implication that it is false, although the implication is not as strong as it is for 'myth'. Legend in some usages is a synonym for 'myth': see e.g. Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, sense 3 &quot;Any wonderful story coming down from the past, but not verifiable by historical record; a myth; a fable.&quot; [http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=legend]

::Right, but a synonym does not necessarily carry the connotation of the original word, as in the case of legend.  The whole point of the word &quot;legend&quot; is to be something upon which people can agree, provided they have no axe to grind (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; that they are not dedicated to using the word &quot;myth&quot; to imply falsehood and that they are not dedicated to the word in question implying absolute veracity) --[[Alex Kennedy]]

=== Option 6 ===

Call the stories &quot;Fooism Mythology and &lt;Religious&gt; Stories&quot;, and include both stories Fooism believe to be true and stories Fooism believes to be false. Let the reader decide which they think are false and which are true. Do not include stories directly from scripture unless there are mythological beliefs as well, outside the scripture itself, and then discuss the mythological aspects. IOW, consider scripture outside of mythology (as in 4 above).

PROS:
*No implication is made about any individual story's truth or falsity. Few people are likely to be offended by acknowledging that all religions have some &quot;mythology&quot; in the pejorative sense, as long as we don't call any particular story a myth.
*Usage is true to convention for Greek Mythology, etc., with two extra words added.
*Does not perpetuate bias against any group.
*Allows you to compare and contrast the stories on their historical and literary qualities without involving their truth except as side notes as to who believes them, staying npov.

CONS:
*Some people still might be offended by the use of &quot;mythology&quot; in reference to *any* stories, but this seems unlikely as long as we make sure the set of stories includes some they consider false or legendary (e.g., Holy Grail myths for Christians).
*It's a bit wordy

=== Option 7 ===

Sometimes there is a well-defined English standard.  Greek mythology is called Greek mythology by pretty much everyone, and in fact Greek religion means something somewhat broader.  Further the term is not inaccurate in anyone's book, since ''myth'' doesn't necessarily imply falsehood (Tolkien, a devout Christian and linguist, had no problems with calling the resurrection a myth).  We shouldn't be in the business of revising the language, we should be in the business of informing people about the topic, so when such a standard exists we should simply adopt it.
:Tolkien never called the resurrection &quot;a myth&quot;. He called it &quot;the true myth&quot; unique amoung mythology (Tolkien saw all mythology as having &quot;shards&quot; of truth) in that it actually happened in history -- [[Asa Winstanley]] - ''Yeah, I know.  Being the true myth makes you a myth.''

CONS:
*This option seems a bit ambiguous. It doesn't seem to clearly answer the question &quot;What should we call the stories of the Bible? Should we call them myths or not?&quot;

ALSO:
*I belive that religion is a absulute waste of time because no one really cares about religion and santa is a big fat peice of shit beacause he is not real and also reinder cant F*****G fly and wiki is shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!

=== Discussion ===

Option 4 provided by [[Cayzle]] (By the way, thanks, Simon, for making this page!)

My preference is also for option 2; this encyclopedia isn't supposed to be written &quot;for&quot; any particular cultural group, and that includes Christians. I see no reason to give their myths special treatment compared to other equivalent stories and/or beliefs just because there are more of them online at the moment. Failing that, I'd accept option 4. I don't like option 3 but I could live with it if the alternative is endless edit-wars, and I ''really'' don't like option 1. - [[Bryan Derksen|BD]]

My preference is obviously for option 5, since I wrote it.  I disagree that using &quot;myths&quot; for everything religious would make the 'pedia NPOV.  I think this would promote an atheist point of view (which is not the same as a neutral point of view) --[[Alex Kennedy]]

Heh. [[English]] is an enormous and akward [[Frankenstein's monster]] of a [[language]], but every once and a while that huge lump of vocabulary comes in handy. &quot;Greek Legends&quot; sounds reasonable to me. - [[Bryan Derksen|BD]]

My preference is six, since I just added it. Failing that, 2, 3, 4. --[[Dmerrill]]

My first preference is still option 2. I'd be okay with option 5 if it involved calling both polytheistic and Jewish/Christian/Islamic stories &quot;legends&quot; -- I'm concerned though that calling Christian stories legends may still offend people, for the term has some negative conontations, although they are not as bad as the word 'myth'. My next choice, after 2 and 5, would be option 3. Options 1, 4 and 6 would be for me my last choice -- I think the three options are fundamentally identical; the only difference is that options 4 and 6 recognizes that there are some Christian stories, (e.g. King Arthur, St. George and the Dragon, etc.), which are probably safe to call 'myths', since few people believe them today. Also, option 6 seeks to separate myth from scripture, but how can we do that in the case of the Greeks or Romans? They didn't have what I would call scripture, so then option 6 isn't really different from option 4, it just has slightly different terminology. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the works of Homer, Hesiod, Vergil, etc., to be scripture -- but in that case many of the stories we commonly call mythology would fall under scripture, not mythology. I'm not exactly sure what option 7 involves (the wording of the option above doesn't clearly answer the question &quot;should we call the stories of the Bible myth or not?&quot;). The main principle that I think ought to be followed in this is: being NPOV is a more fundamental value for an encyclopedia than either clarity or avoiding offense.

I think its a good thing that people have added options in addition to the three I originally provided, but I think we should try to prune the options available down from 7 to a more manageable number, to help us decide more clearly. I would propose merging options 1 and 4 together, and removing option 7 (unless its author wants to try to make clearer exactly what it proposes.) -- [[SJK]]

:Option 7 was actually intended more as a constraint on what our options are, then an option in and of itself.  The whole ''stories from the Greek religion'' thing was silly, firstly because there were several Greek religions, but more particularly because Greek mythology is the almost universal name for those.  Whatever are standards end up as, we want to call them myths, because that is what they are called - even to the point of inconsistency, I'd say.

I'm a Christian and I kinda favour 6. But i would prefer scriptures are refered to as stories, extra scriptual as myths and polytheistic stuff as myths (i understand this in the Tolkien way - containing elements of truth, that are ultimately looking forwards to the &quot;true myth&quot; - the life death and ressurection of Jesus Christ.). Failing those, 1. There is a huge difference between (e.g.) the Iiliad and (e.g.) the Bible. Hmm.. maybe merging 1&amp;amp;4 will producing something good. We'll see - [[Asa Winstanley]]
:Asa, I can see how there is a huge difference between the Iliad and the Bible from the point of view of your personal religious beliefs -- but can you point to any huge and relevant religiously neutral differences (i.e. major differences, which are relevant to what we should call them, and which both a Christian and an ancient Greek who believed the Iliad could agree on)?  -- [[SJK]]

:Some people may be concerned that the term &quot;greek mythology&quot; is nothing more than Christian propoganda against polytheistic religions.  What is the origin of the term, anyway? -- [[hagedis]]

I guess you already know what I think about this.  I think most of these options are obvious nonstarters. --[[LMS]]

I have added &quot;replies&quot; under three points above.  I hope no one minds.  Feel free to reply to the replies, of course (that'd only be fair). --[[LMS]]

Someone added to my point about some saying that &quot;myth&quot; is used without the intention of implying falsehood that the some was &quot;a minority of English speakers&quot;. You missed the point. Pick up a book about Greek myths. Is the message of the book going to be &quot;These are all made up stories and you shouldn't believe in them unless you are stupid or irrational&quot;? I don't think so. So even if the reader, when they hear the word &quot;myth&quot;, may get the impression that we are saying &quot;you are a fool if you believe them&quot;, most of the time that is not our intention -- our intention is to talk about the content of the myths. -- [[SJK]]

:However, part of the point is also that you will be a fool if you don't think that these stories have something serious to say (why we use the word &quot;myth&quot; rather than &quot;fable&quot;, &quot;folktale&quot;, &quot;silly story&quot;, etc.)

::Simon, if you're going to attempt to make a Wikipedia policy page, be prepared for it to be generally edited; you don't control it.  I think you're misunderstanding the point.  The point is not that some people believe &quot;myth&quot; means &quot;false story,&quot; pure and simple.  Notice that the definition says myths &quot;are not to be relied upon as true, though, for all we know, they might be true.&quot;  This doesn't imply that people are fools to believe myths, but they certainly would be ''gullible'' to believe anything simply handed down by tradition, without further evidence.  Again, I am firmly persuaded that this is how ''most'' people understand what &quot;myth&quot; means.
:I don't own this page -- everyone has the right to edit it. But, IIRC, I originally wrote that sentence, and the addition of &quot;a minority of English speakers&quot; makes it say something different from what I was trying to say. I was trying to say that, in most serious discussions of ancient myths (as opposed to other uses of the word &quot;myth&quot;), the primary point of using the word &quot;myth&quot; is not to convey the idea that they are false or ought not be believed or are probably not true, but rather that they are stories with certain features. It is not a usage; it is an opinion about most people's usage in that particular context. Adding &quot;a minority of English speakers&quot; seems to me to be a misunderstanding that this represents a usage rather than an opinion about most people's usages -- [[SJK]]

Some may consider what I'm about to say non-contributory, but I think this whole discussion is a bit silly. Setting policy on acceptable word-use to avoid offending people is, in my mind, dopey. Anything that is written will offend somebody. Instead of worrying about what readers will think (since if they have a strong opinion, they can just edit the entries), just write what ''you'' think. Standards of this kind are, in my mind, unnecessary, misguided, and stifling. --TheCunctator
:Actually, I think now I agree with you Cunctator. I was so concerned about '''how''' this should be done, I didn't stop to consider '''if''' it should be done. Its not really needed. [[User:Asa Winstanley|AW]]

::Well, we certainly don't need a &quot;Wikipedia Religion and Mythology standards&quot; page to discuss this tiny issue.  I'm insisting on the point mainly because I think it's very important what our joint understanding of what the [[neutral point of view]] policy entails--but also, indeed, because we shouldn't offend large important classes of Wikipedia writers and readers simply because we think it's sophisticated and clever to refer to Christian traditional stories as &quot;myth.&quot;  My impression is that some people (not just Simon or the original author of [[Christian Mythology]]) are adamant about ''not'' going out of their way to accommodate views with which they disagree.  I am trying to encourage the view that we should do this as much as we can.  Even though I am not a Christian, I think it is extremely important that we do our best not to trivialize their opinions, and I think I've got excellent reason to believe that using the phrase &quot;Christian mythology&quot; uncritically, without deep discussion of the very meaning and import of the phrase, ''does'' trivialize their opinions.  Moreover, I am firmly persuaded that we can avoid trivializing their opinions ''without'' ignoring what happens to be ''my own'' opinion, that in fact, very many traditional Christian stories ''are'' little more than myths. --[[LMS]]
:I created a &quot;Wikipedia Religion and Mythology standards&quot; page because I thought this sort of discussion belongs on some form of meta page, not any particular article's Talk page, since it could touch several different articles. The inspiration for the name came from &quot;Wikipedia History standards&quot; -- possibly if we had this page here, people might be inspired to add other standards/guidelines/proposals/whatever to it. Secondly, calling Christian stories myths should not offend anyone if we make clear what definition of &quot;myth&quot; we are using when we do so. (Of course, some people may still be offended after this, but people like that aren't using their noggins.) I'm not trying to trivalize the opinions of Christians -- I'm an on and off Christian myself. This dispute has absolutely nothing to do with people's views about religion, it is about what meaning should we attach to the word &quot;myth&quot;, a word which is used in two different senses (however much most people fail to clearly distinguish them). And I'm not too sure what deep discussion you need here -- explaining that &quot;when we call a story a myth, we are not saying it is false or dubious or unlikely to be true: despite the popular usage to the contrary, we are merely saying that it is a story about events that it claims happened in the past, and which express the beliefs, morals, etc&quot; of the people who believe it. Isn't that deep enough? -- [[SJK]]




From a lurker...

I think '''Option 4''' makes the most sense, with one modification.  I would take stories like St. George and the dragon, etc., as &quot;legendary&quot;.  Why?  precisely because of the nuance that &quot;legend&quot; gives...i.e., maybe just a little more rooted in something historical.  By the same token, I'd want to put Gilgamesh under legend rather than myth...maybe.  It's  a fuzzy area.  Back to the main point, though -- It's perfectly sensible to discuss ancient myth vs. sacred texts.  First, there is a rich tradition in English-language scholarship that supports it.  Second, ancient religion, at least for the Greeks and Romans (and I think  for the Celts and Germans, from what we actually can prove) was about worship, NOT BELIEF.  Belief was not required, just the proper observation of ritual.  Third, one of the old standards of myth still holds -- most, if not all, myths, explain natural phenomena within the context of actions of gods and heroes.  With the exception of the creation story and the flood in the Bible, most of it doesn't fit that definition of myth.    --My $.05
:I'd be interested in some more detail on this &quot;rich tradition&quot; of scholarship that supports &quot;ancient myth vs. sacred texts&quot;. Secondly, belief was, at least in some cases, required -- remember Socrates' trial on charges of atheism? Third, I admit that is a difference between most ancient myths and most Bible stories (but there are some differences), but even if that is true, and we shouldn't call those bible stories myths, stories like the Creation, Fall and the Flood are myths, and have a lot of analogs in other cultures (countless creation myths; lots of flood myths in that area as well; also quite a few cultures have explanations of how evil entered the world, e.g. Pandora's box). -- [[SJK]]

:It's hard to apply ''myth'' to widely held current beliefs, especially religious beliefs. This usage offends or bewilders the faithful (like me). Exception: &quot;creation myth&quot; seems okay somehow (don't ask me why, it just does).

If anyone is worried about the wikipedia inadvertently endorsing a particular religious view (or even religion in general), we already have a way with dealing with that. There are many NOPV phrases such as:
:widely held
:no longer generally believed
:according to some
:hotly contested

[[Ed Poor]]

I wouldn't characterize those as NPOV phrases, but as vaguely qualifying phrases. 

... or as they're known in marketing circles, weasel words.

I have the answer, and it is simple.  'Saga' can be used instead of myth (which does have certain connotations).  I don't find the same one with saga.

Maybe it is just that the ancients preferred alegory?
A true myth: Wheat grows best if the sower is nude! This may be because a compassionate (but maybe not omnipotent) God sees the sower as too poor to buy clothes, as originally proposed, or perhaps it is because it is not very convenient to be walking naked on either wet or baked land, or when the wind blows, or the weather is unpleasant? Now, guess what conditions are ideal for seed germination?

----
Of all the options I support '''Option 4''' best. I think the King Arthur stories are certainly okay to be called 'legend' or 'myth.' However, texts like the Bible or the Torah should be treated with respect and to label it as a 'myth' sounds as if there is no proof that it is real, and that it's sort of a fairy tale. Things that aren't directly in the Bible, for instance, wouldn't offend nearly as many people as calling things actually in the Bible a 'myth.' For instance, calling the flood in the Bible the ''deluge myth'' could be pretty painful to people who truly believe in it. Calling those things a 'myth' might ''not'' be neutral, actually - it could be writing from the side of unbelievers.

If Option 4 is really disliked, then, okay, Option 3. It's not as good as Option 4, because stuff like Greek mythology so few people believe, and so little proof exists that any of it is true, that to term it a myth would be just fine. For some religions, like Judaism, or Christianity, ''not'' calling them a myth might be offensive.

So, I think Option 4 is the best. It would be much less offensive to most people.

And by the bye, I do not think the 'legend' option is very good, if you will allow me to say so. Legend still implies that the belief is false, and this can still be offensive. Though it's a little better than myth there isn't enough difference to make it a good solution. [[User:Classical Esther|Classical Esther]] 07:05, 20 December 2009 (UTC)

I support Option 3. It allows for remaining neutral about religion, without making any distinction. Another option suggested redirects, and I think they could be applied so people can still find what they are looking for. [[User:Aroni125|Aroni125]] 20:47, 4 January 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, I saw on [[Larry Sanger]]'s to do list at [[Larry Sanger/To do]] that he planned to form a philosophy about the international wikipedia question.  Could someone enlighten me as to what that question is?  Also, feel free to move this to meta if this is where you feel it belongs...

--[[user:Chuck_Smith|Chuck_Smith]]
----
Yep, should be moved to[http://meta.wikipedia.com Meta-Wikipedia] or else [[Intlwiki-L]], where a lengthy discussion of said question has already taken place!  See the archives. --[[LMS]]
----
Today, I reread all of the archive of [[Intlwiki-L]], but I do not understand what ''the'' question is...  What is it? --[[Chuck Smith]]
----
There are several questions.  The main one that bothers me is whether and how Wikipedia articles in different languages might be made to correspond to one another. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
For link management between international wikis, I will (in time) make &lt;nowiki&gt;[[de:Krimskrams]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as a link to a Krimskrams article in the German wikipedia. If this is put into the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; article, it won't display as a normal link, but list it as &quot;German version of this article&quot; somewhere in the framework. Once a day/week/etc. all wikipedias could be automatically cross-referenced, keeping ''all'' of these links in ''all'' wikipedias up to date.

We can also use {{de:Krimskrams}} or {{{de:Krimskrams}}}, if you want the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[de:Krimskrams]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; version for &quot;normal&quot; linking. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

----
What about a drop down menu in the navigation bar that links to all the pedias? --[[user:joao|joao]]
----
If you still wanted to do the instantly jump to another language idea then one way to implement would be to use the same approach as the Traduki project which uses Esperanto as an interlanguage since 99% of Esperanto words have only one definition.  The dictionaries on travlang.com also uses this method (using Esperanto) on their multilingual online translation.  Just an idea...  

This also fits because Esperanto was basically an open source project before the term open source project was coined.  One guy designed the foundation of the language and then tons of people from different countries worked on it from there...  Also, because of the nature of the Esperanto community, I imagine that the Esperanta vikipedio will become a strong community once the pages are transformed into Unicode (which we're patiently or impatiently waiting for...) --[[user:Chuck_Smith|Chuck_Smith]]
----
But not enough people know Esperanto!

Sorry we haven't gotten around to changing the code.  You can always pester Jimbo again at jwales at bomis.com.

The problem isn't mainly a technical one.  It's mainly a sort of philosophical or policy one: ''should'' we make articles correspond to one another?  If so, how? --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
True, there aren't enough people who know Esperanto... so I'll do all the work!  j/k  ;-)

I like the link idea of syntax &lt;nowiki&gt;[[de:article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to link to the German wikipedia and these would be quality links because then people would only add them if the content was good (at least in principle).  It seems ashame that knowledge on the Internet is still divided by language.  I believe those who know more than one language would appreciate seeing a link to view another language they might know better.  The slants on articles in different languages is quite fascinating! --[[user:Chuck_Smith|Chuck_Smith]]

Hi, i'm [[Tuxisuau]] and I am near alone in the Catalan Wikipedia project. I did a bit of work, but before letting people come in thousands, i need to solve some problems. Should I use characters like àáä¢ï· in article names? Should i use them inside the articles? What i've got to do with existing articles with wrong names (some have &quot;'`&quot;'s and some have not but then they are wrong written)?. Help!

--[[Tuxisuau]]
----
Well, I think for a temporary solution I really like the {{de:Katze}} to link to the German wikipedia and this would simply add to the sidebar on the side of that article, ''Other languages:'' and list which other languages this article is in.  I'm really getting tired of writing articles in the English and Esperanto language wikipedias and not easily being able to link them together... --[[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]]

&lt;h2&gt;Executive summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia has an important policy: roughly stated, you should write
articles without bias, representing all views fairly.  Wikipedia uses the
words &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; in a special sense!  This ''doesn't'' mean that
it's possible to write an article from ''just one'' point of view, ''the''
neutral (unbiased, &quot;objective&quot;) point of view.  That's a common
''misunderstanding'' of the Wikipedia policy.  The Wikipedia policy is that
we should ''fairly represent'' all sides of a dispute, and not make an
article state, imply, or insinuate that any one side is correct.  It's
crucial that we work ''together'' to make articles unbiased.  It's one of
the things that makes Wikipedia work so well.  Writing unbiased text is an
art that requires practice.  The following essay explains this policy in
depth, and is the result of much discussion.  We strongly encourage you to
read it.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction: the basic concept of neutrality and why Wikipedia must be
unbiased&lt;/h2&gt;

A key [[Wikipedia]] policy is that
articles should be &quot;unbiased,&quot; or written from a &quot;neutral point of view.&quot;
We use these terms in a precise way that is different from the common
understanding.  It's crucial to grasp what it means to be neutral (in this
sense)--a careful reading of this page will help.

Basically, to write without bias (from a neutral point of view) is to write
so that articles do not advocate any specific points of view; instead, the
different viewpoints in a controversy are ''all described fairly.''  This is
a simplistic definition and we'll add nuance later.  But for now, we can say
just that to write articles without bias is to try to ''describe'' debates
''rather than'' taking one definite stand.

Why should Wikipedia be unbiased?

Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, which means it is a representation of
human knowledge at some level of generality.  But we (humans) disagree about
specific cases; for any topic on which there are competing views, each view
represents a different theory of what the truth is, and insofar as that view
contradicts other views, its adherents believe that the other views are
false, and therefore not ''knowledge''.  Indeed, Wikipedia, there are many
opinionated people who often disagree with each other.  Where there is
disagreement about what is true, there's disagreement about what constitutes
knowledge. Wikipedia works because it's a collaborative effort; but, whilst
collaborating, how can we solve the problem of endless &quot;edit wars&quot; in which
one person asserts that ''p,'' whereupon the next person changes the text so
that it asserts that ''not-p''?

The solution is that we accept, for purposes of working on Wikipedia, that
&quot;human knowledge&quot; includes ''all different'' (significant, published)
theories on all different topics.  So we're committed to the goal of
representing human knowledge in ''that'' sense.  Something like this is
surely a well-established sense of the word &quot;knowledge&quot;; in this sense, what
is &quot;known&quot; has changes constantly with the passage of time, and when we use
the word &quot;know&quot; in the sense, we often use so-called scare quotes.  In the
Middle Ages, we &quot;knew&quot; that the Earth was flat.  We now &quot;know&quot; otherwise.

We could sum up human knowledge (in this sense) in a biased way: we'd state
a series of theories about topic T, and then claim that the truth about T is
such-and-such.  But again, consider that Wikipedia is an international,
collaborative project.  Probably, as we grow, nearly every view on every
subject will (eventually) be found among our authors and readership.  To
avoid endless edit wars, we should agree to present each of these views
fairly, and not make our articles assert any one of them as correct.  And
that is what makes an article &quot;unbiased&quot; or &quot;neutral.&quot;  To write from a
neutral point of view, one presents controversial views without asserting
them; to do ''that,'' it generally suffices to present competing views in a
way that is more or less acceptable to their adherents, and also to
''attribute'' the views to their adherents.

To sum up the primary reason for this policy: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia,
a compilation of human knowledge.  But since Wikipedia is a community-built,
international resource, we surely cannot expect our collaborators to agree
in all cases, or even in many cases, on what constitutes human knowledge in
a strict sense.  We should, therefore, adopt the looser sense of &quot;human
knowledge&quot; according to which a wide variety of conflicting theories
constitute what we call &quot;human knowledge.&quot;  We must make an effort to
present these conflicting theories fairly, without advocating any one of
them.

There is another reason to commit ourselves to a nonbias policy.  Namely,
when it is clear to readers that we do not expect them to adopt any
particular opinion, this is conducive to our readers' feeling free to make
up their own minds for themselves, and thus to encourage in them
''intellectual independence''.  So totalitarian governments and dogmatic
institutions everywhere have reason to be opposed to Wikipedia, if we
succeed in adhering to our nonbias policy: the presentation of many
competing theories on a wide variety of subjects suggests that we, the
creators of Wikipedia, trust readers' competence to form their own opinions
themselves.  Texts that present the merits of multiple viewpoints fairly,
without demanding that the reader accept any one of them, are liberating.
Neutrality subverts dogmatism.  This is something that nearly everyone
working on Wikipedia can agree is a good thing.

&lt;h2&gt;What is the neutral point of view?  What do we mean by &quot;unbiased&quot; and
&quot;neutral&quot;?&lt;/h2&gt;

The answer isn't obvious.

Essentially, &quot;unbiased writing&quot; means &quot;presenting controversial views
without asserting them.&quot;  Unfortunately, this is often misunderstood.  So we
offer the following clarifications with the hope that they will clear away
the many possible misunderstandings of what unbiased writing, or writing
from a neutral point of view, amounts to.

First, and most importantly, consider what it means to say that unbiased
writing presents controversial views without asserting them.  Unbiased
writing does not ''present only'' the most popular view; it does not
''assert'' the most popular view as being correct after presenting all
views; it does not assert that some sort of intermediate view among the
different views is the correct one (as if the intermediate view were &quot;the
neutral point of view&quot;).  Unbiased writing says, more or less, that
''p''-ists believe that ''p,'' and ''q''-ists believe that ''q,'' and that's
where the debate stands at present.  Ideally, unbiased writing also gives a
great deal of background on who believes that ''p'' and ''q'' and why, and
which view is more popular (being careful, here, not to word the statement
so as to imply that ''popularity'' implies ''correctness'').  Detailed
articles might also contain the mutual evaluations of the ''p''-ists and the
''q''-ists, allowing each side to give its &quot;best shot&quot; at the other, but
studiously refraining from saying who won the exchange.

A point here bears elaboration.  We said that the neutral point of view is
not, contrary to the seeming implication of the phrase, some actual ''point
of view'' on a controversial issue that is &quot;neutral,&quot; or &quot;intermediate,&quot;
among the different positions.  That represents a gross misunderstanding of
what &quot;neutral point of view&quot; means.  Properly speaking, the neutral point of
view is not a ''point of view'' at all, because when one writes neutrally,
one is very careful not to state (or imply or insinuate or carefully but
subtly massage the reader into believing) that ''any particular view at
all'' is correct.

Another point bears elaboration as well.  Writing unbiasedly can be
conceived very well as ''representing'' disputes, ''characterizing'' them,
rather than engaging in them.  One can think of unbiased writing as the
cold, fair, analytical description of debates.  Of course, one might well
doubt that this can be done at all without somehow subtly implying or
insinuating that one position is correct.  But experienced academics,
polemical writers, and rhetoricians are well-attuned to bias, so that they
can usually spot a description of a debate that tends to favor one side.

Now an important qualification.  We need not give minority views ''as much''
or as detailed a description as more popular views, in articles comparing
the views.  We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held
by only a small minority of people deserved as much attention as a very
popular view.  That would in fact be misleading as to the shape of the
dispute.  If we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should (in most if
not all cases) present various competing views in proportion to their
representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties.
None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much
attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to
those views.  But even on such pages, though the content of a view is
spelled out possibly in great detail, we still make sure that the view is
not represented as ''the truth.''

Bias ''per se'' need not be conscious or particularly partisan.  For
example, beginners in a field often fail to realize that what sounds like
uncontroversial common sense is actually biased in favor of one
controversial view.  (So we not infrequently need an expert in order to
render the article entirely unbiased.)  To take another example, writers
can, without intending it, propagate &quot;geographical&quot; bias, by for example
describing a dispute ''as it is conducted in the United States'' (or some
other country), without knowing that the dispute is framed differently
elsewhere.

Objection: impossible to remove all bias.  Indeed, it seems that if we can
''detect'' bias, we can, if we are creative, ''remove'' it as well.

&lt;h2&gt;Alternative formulation of the policy: assert facts, including facts
about opinions--but don't assert opinions themselves&lt;/h2&gt;

We sometimes give an alternative formulation of the nonbias policy: assert
facts, including facts about opinions--but don't assert opinions themselves.
By &quot;fact,&quot; on the one hand, we mean &quot;a piece of information about which
there is no serious dispute.&quot;  In this sense, that a survey produced a
certain published result is a fact.  That the Mars is a planet is a fact.
That 2+2=4 is a fact.  That Socrates was a philosopher is a fact.  No one
seriously disputes any of these things.  So Wikipedians can feel free to
''assert'' as many of them as we can.  By &quot;opinion,&quot; on the other hand, we
mean &quot;a piece of information about which there is some serious dispute.&quot;
There's bound to be [[borderline case]]s where we're not sure if we should
take a particular dispute seriously; but there are many propositions that
very clearly express opinions.  That God exists is an opinion.  That the
Beatles were the greatest rock and roll group is an opinion.  That
intuitionistic logic is superior to ordinary logic is an opinion.  That the
United States was wrong to drop the atomic bomb over Hiroshima and Nagasaki
is an opinion.

For determining whether something is fact or opinion in this sense, it does
not matter what the actual truth of the matter is; there can at least in
theory be false &quot;facts&quot; (things that ''everybody'' agrees upon, but which
are, in fact, false), and there are very often true &quot;opinions,&quot; though
necessarily, it seems, more false ones than true.

Wikipedia is devoting to stating facts and only facts, in this sense.  Where
we might want to state opinions, we convert that opinion into a fact by
''attributing'' the opinion to someone.  So, rather than asserting, &quot;God
exists,&quot; which is an opinion, we can say, &quot;Most Americans believe that God
exists,&quot; which is a fact, or &quot;Thomas Aquinas believed that God exists,&quot;
which is also a fact.  In the first instance we assert an opinion; in the
second and third instances we convert that opinion into a fact by
attributing it to someone.

But it's not ''enough,'' to express the Wikipedia nonbias policy, just to
say that we should state facts and not opinions.  When asserting a fact
''about an opinion,'' it is important ''also'' to assert facts ''about
competing opinions,'' and to do so without implying that any one of the
opinions is correct.  It's also generally important to give the facts about
the reasons behind the views, and to make it clear who holds them.  (It's
often best to cite a prominent representative of the view.)

&lt;h2&gt;Fairness and sympathetic tone&lt;/h2&gt;

If we're going to characterize disputes fairly, fairness demands we present
competing views with a consistently positive, sympathetic tone. A fair
number of articles end up as fairly partisan commentary ''even while''
presenting both points of view; this is wrong.  Even when a topic is
presented in terms of facts rather than opinion, an article can still
radiate an implied stance through either selection of which facts to
present, or more subtly their organization--for instance, refuting opposing
views as one goes makes them look a lot worse than collecting them in an
opinions-of-opponents section.

We should, instead, write articles with the tone that ''all'' positions
presented are at least plausible.  Let's present all competing views
sympathetically.  We can write with the attitude that such-and-such is a
good idea, except that, on the view of some detractors, the supporters of
said view overlooked such-and-such a detail.  If we can't do that, we will
probably write stuff with so much contempt that subsequent edits are going
to have a hard time doing anything but veiling it.

&lt;h2&gt;Characterizing opinions of people's artistic and other work&lt;/h2&gt;

A special case is the expression of aesthetic opinions.  Some Wikipedia
articles about art, artists, and other creative topics (e.g., musicians,
actors, books, video games, etc.) have tended toward the effusive.  This is,
we can agree, out of place in an encyclopedia; we might not all be able to
agree that so-and-so is the greatest bass guitar player in history.  But it
is very important information indeed how some artist or some work has been
received by the general public, by reviewers, or by some very prominent
experts.  Providing an overview of the common interpretations of a creative
work, preferably with citations or references to notable individuals holding
that interpretation, is appropriate.  For instance, that Shakespeare is one
of the greatest authors of the English language is an important bit of
knowledge a schoolchild might need to learn from an encyclopedia.  Notice,
determining how some artist or work has been received publicly or critically
might require research; but that reception, unlike the idiosyncratic opinion
of the Wikipedia article writer, is an opinion that really matters, for
purposes of an encyclopedia.

&lt;h2&gt;A consequence: writing for the enemy&lt;/h2&gt;

Those who constantly attempt to advocate their own views on politically
charged topics (for example), who seem not to care at all about whether
other points of view are represented fairly, are violating the nonbias
policy (&quot;write unbiasedly&quot;).  This entails that it is our job to speak for
the other side, and not just represent our own views. If we don't commit
ourselves to doing that, Wikipedia will be much, much weaker for it.  We
should all be engaged in explaining each other's points of view as
sympathetically as possible.

In saying this, we are explicitly spelling out what might have been obvious
to some people from an initial reading of the policy.  If each of us
''individually'' is permitted to write totally biased stuff in our Wikipedia
contributions, then how is it possible that the policy is ever ''violated''?
The policy ''says,'' &quot;Go thou and write unbiasedly&quot; (or something to that
effect).  If that ''doesn't'' entail that we should fairly represent views
with which we disagree, then what ''does'' it mean?  Maybe you think it
means, &quot;Represent your own view fairly, but if you must only ''grudgingly''
allow others to have a say, please allow them to do so.&quot;  Maybe that makes a
bit of sense as an interpretation--not a lot, but a bit.  But consider, if
we each take responsibility for ''the entire'' article when we hit that
&quot;save&quot; button, then when we make a change to an article that represents
''our own'' views but not contrary views, or represents contrary views
unfairly or incompletely (etc.), surely we are adding bias to Wikipedia.
And does it really ever make sense ''not'' to take responsibility for the
entire article?  Does it make sense to prise out sentences and say, &quot;These
are mine, those are yours&quot;?  Perhaps, but in the context of a project that
is so strongly and explicitly committed to neutrality, that sort of attitude
seems totally out of place!

The other side might very well find your attempts to characterize their
views substandard, but it's the thought that counts.  In resolving disputes
over neutrality issues, it's far better that we acknowledge that all sides
must be presented fairly, and make at least a college try at presenting the
other sides fairly.  That will be appreciated much more than not trying at
all.

&quot;Writing for the enemy&quot; might make it seem as if we were adding
''deliberately'' flawed arguments to Wikipedia, which would be a very
strange thing to do.  But it's better to view this (otherwise
puzzling)behavior as adding the ''best'' (published) arguments of the
opposition, preferably citing some prominent person who has actually made
the argument in the form in which you present it, stating them as
sympathetically as possible.  Academics, e.g., philosophers, do this all the
time.

&lt;h2&gt;An example&lt;/h2&gt;

It might help to consider an example of a biased text and how Wikipedians
have rendered it at least relatively unbiased.

On the [[abortion]] page, early in
2001, some advocates had used the page to exchange rhetorical barbs, being
unable to agree about what arguments should be on the page and how the
competing positions should be represented.  What was needed--and what was
added--was an in-depth discussion of the different positions about the moral
and legal viability of abortion at different times.  This discussion of the
positions was carefully crafted so as not to favor any one of the positions
outlined.  This made it rather easier to organize and understand the
competing arguments surrounding the topic of abortion, which were each then
presented sympathetically, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

There are numerous other &quot;success stories&quot; of articles that began life as
virtual partisan screeds but were nicely cleaned up by people who concerned
themselves with representing all views clearly and sympathetically.

&lt;h2&gt;Objections and clarifications&lt;/h2&gt;

What follows is a list of common objections, or questions, regarding
Wikipedia's nonbias policy, followed by replies.

&lt;h3&gt;There's no such thing as objectivity.  Everybody with any philosophical
sophistication knows that.  So how can we take the &quot;neutrality&quot; policy
seriously?  Neutrality, lack of bias, isn't possible.&lt;/h3&gt;

This is probably the most common objection to the neutrality policy.  It
also reflects the most common ''misunderstanding'' of the policy (which, by
the way, was drafted originally for [[Nupedia]] by a philosopher).  The misunderstanding is that the policy says
something controversial about the possibility of ''objectivity.''  It simply
does not.  In particular, the policy does ''not'' say that there is even
''is'' such a thing as objectivity, a &quot;view from nowhere&quot; (in
[[Thomas Nagel]]'s phrase)--such
that articles written from ''that'' point of view are consequently
objectively true.  That isn't the policy and it is not our aim!  Rather, we
employ a different understanding of &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;unbiased&quot; than many of us
might be used to.  The policy is simply that we should do our best to
characterize disputes rather than engage in them. To say ''this'' is not to
say anything contentious, from a philosophical point of view; indeed, this
is something that philosophers are doing all the time, even strongly
relativist philosophers.  (They are virtually required to be able to first
characterize their opponents' views fairly, in order to avoid being accused
of setting up straw men to knock down.)  Sophisticated relativists will
immediately recognize that the policy is perfectly consistent with their
relativism.

If there's ''anything'' possibly contentious about the policy along these
lines, it is the implication that it is ''possible'' to characterize
disputes fairly, so that all the major participants will be able to look at
the resulting text, agreeing that their views are presented sympathetically
and as completely as possible (within the context of the discussion).  It is
an empirical question, not a philosophical one, whether this is possible;
and that such a thing ''is'' indeed possible is evident simply by observing
that such texts are being written daily by the most capable academics,
encyclopedists, textbook writers, and journalists.

&lt;h3&gt;How are we to write articles about pseudoscientific topics, about which
majority scientific opinion is that the pseudoscientific opinion is not
credible and doesn't even really deserve serious mention?&lt;/h3&gt;

If we're going to represent the sum total of &quot;human knowledge&quot;--of what we
believe we know, essentially--then we must concede that we will be
describing views repugnant to us without asserting that they are false.
Things are not, however, as bad as that sounds.  The task before us is not
to describe disputes fairly, ''on some bogus view of fairness'' that would
have us describe pseudoscience as if were on a par with science; rather, the
task is to represent the majority (scientific) view as the majority view and
the minority (sometimes pseudoscientific) view as the minority view, and,
moreover, to explain how scientists have received pseudoscientific theories.
This is all in the purview of the task of ''describing a dispute fairly.''

There is a minority of Wikipedians who feel so strongly about this problem,
however, that they believe Wikipedia should adopt a &quot;scientific point of
view&quot; rather than a &quot;neutral point of view.&quot;  What these people have failed
to establish, however, is that there is really a need for such a policy,
''given that'' the scientists' view of pseudoscience can be clearly, fully,
and fairly explained to those who might be misled by pseudoscience.

&lt;h3&gt;What about views that are morally offensive to most Westerners, such as
racism, sexism, and Holocaust denial, that some people actually have?
Surely we are not to be neutral about &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;

We can certainly include long discussions that present our moral repugnance
to such things; in doing so, we can maintain a healthy, consistent support
for the neutral point of view by attributing the view to some prominent
representatives or to some group of people.  Others will be able to make up
their own minds and, being reasonable, surely come around to our view.
Those who harbor racism, sexism, etc., will surely not be convinced to
change their views based on a biased article, which only puts them on the
defensive; on the other hand, if we make a concerted effort to apply our
nonbias policy consistently, we might give those with morally repugnant
beliefs insight that will change those views.

&lt;h3&gt;But wait. I find the optimism about science vs. pseudo-science to be
baseless. History has shown that pseudo-science can beat out facts, as those
who rely on pseudo-science use lies, slander, innuendo and numercial
majorities of its followers to force their views on the anyone they can.  If
this project gives equal validity to those who literally claim that the
Earth is flat, or those who claim that the Holocaust never occured, the
result is that it will (inadvertently) legitimize and help promote that
which only can be termed evil.&lt;/h3&gt;

Please be clear on one thing: the Wikipedia neutrality policy certainly
''does not'' state, or imply, that we must &quot;give equal validity&quot; to
completely repugnant views.  It does state that we must not take a stand on
them ''qua'' encyclopedia writers; but that does not stop us from
representing the majority views ''as such''; from fairly explaining the
strong arguments against the repugnant views; from describing the strong
moral repugnance that many decent people feel toward them; and so forth.

Hence, on the one hand, Wikipedia does not officially take a stand even on
such obvious issues, but on the other, it will not look as though we (the
authors of Wikipedia) had accorded equal credibility to morally repugnant
views.  Given that the authors of Wikipedia represent a rough cross-section
of the educated public, our readers can expect us to have a similar
cross-section of opinion about extremism: most of us abhor it.

&lt;h3&gt;Wikipedia seems to have an Americo-centric point of view.  Isn't this
contrary to the neutral point of view?&lt;/h3&gt;

Yes, it certainly is, and it has no defenders on Wikipedia.  The presence of
articles written from an exclusively United States point of view is merely a
reflection of the fact that there are many Americans working on the project,
which in turn is merely a reflection of the fact that the (English) project
is being conducted in English and that so many Americans are online.

This is an ongoing problem that can be corrected by active collaboration
from people outside of the U.S., of whom there are many.

&lt;h3&gt;The neutrality policy is used sometimes as an excuse to delete texts
that are perceived as biased.  Isn't this a problem?&lt;/h3&gt;

In many cases, yes.  Most of us believe that the ''mere'' fact that some
text is biased is not enough, by itself, to delete the text outright.  If it
contains perfectly valid information, the text should simply be edited
accordingly, and certainly not deleted.

There's sometimes trouble determining whether some claim is true or useful,
particularly when there are few people on board who know about the topic.
In such a case, it's a good idea to raise objections on a [[talk page]]; if
one has some reason to believe that the author of the biased material will
not be induced to change it, we have sometimes taken to removing the text to
the talk page itself (but certainly not deleting it entirely).  But the
latter should be done more or less as a last resort, never merely as a way
of punishing people who have written something biased.

&lt;h3&gt;I agree with the nonbias policy but there are some here who seem
completely, irremediably biased.  I have to go around and clean up after
them.  What do I do?&lt;/h3&gt;

This is a very difficult question.

Unless the case is really egregious, maybe the best thing is to call
attention to the problem publicly, pointing the perpetrators to this page
(but [[Wikipetiquette|politely]]--one gets
more flies with honey) and asking others to help.  If the problem is
''really'' serious, [[Larry Sanger]] might be enlisted to
beat the person over the head (so to speak) and, in the most recalcitrant
cases, ask them to leave the project.  There must surely be a point beyond
which our very strong interest in being a ''completely'' open project is
trumped by the interest the vast majority of our writers have, in being able
to get work done without constantly having to fix the intrusions of people
who do not respect our policy.

&lt;h3&gt;How can we avoid constant and endless warfare over neutrality
issues?&lt;/h3&gt;

Would that people asked this question more often.  We should ''never''
debate about ''how'' Wikipedia should be biased.  It shouldn't be biased
''at all.''

The best way to avoid warfare over bias is to remember that we are all
reasonably intelligent, articulate people here, or we wouldn't be working on
this and caring so much about it.  We have to make it our ''goal'' to
understand each others' perspectives and to ''work hard'' to make sure that
those other perspectives are fairly represented.  When any dispute arises as
to what the article &quot;should&quot; say or what is &quot;true,&quot; we must not adopt an
adversarial stance; we must do our best to ''step back'' and ask ourselves,
&quot;How can this dispute be fairly characterized?&quot;  This has to be asked
repeatedly as each new controversial point is stated.  It is not our job to
edit Wikipedia so that it reflects our own idiosyncratic views and then
defend those edits against all comers; it is our job to work together,
mainly adding new content, but also, when necessary, coming to a compromise
about how a controversy should be described, so that it is fair to all
sides.

&lt;h3&gt;What about the case where, in order to write any of a long series of
articles on some general subject, we must make some controversial
assumptions?  That's the case, e.g., in writing about evolution.  Surely we
won't have to hash out the evolution-vs.-creationism debate on every such
page?&lt;/h3&gt;

No, surely not.  There are virtually no topics that could not proceed
without making some assumptions that ''someone'' would find controversial.
This is true not only in evolutionary biology, but also philosophy, history,
physics, etc.

It is difficult to draw up general principles on which to rule in specific
cases, but the following might help: there is probably not a good reason to
discuss some assumption on a given page, if an assumption is best discussed
in depth on some ''other'' page.  Some brief, unobtrusive pointer might be
apropos, however.  E.g., in an article about the evolutionary development of
horses, we might have one brief sentence to the effect that some
creationists do not believe that horses (or any other animals) underwent any
evolution, and point the reader to the relevant article.  If there is much
specific argumentation on some particular point, it might be placed on a
special page of its own.

&lt;h3&gt;I'm not convinced by what you say about &quot;writing for the enemy.&quot;  I
don't want to write for the enemy.  Most of them rely on stating as fact
many things which are demonstrably false.  Are you saying that, to be
neutral in writing an article, I must ''lie,'' in order to faithfully
represent the view I disagree with?&lt;/h3&gt;

This is a misunderstanding what the neutrality policy says.  ''You'' aren't
claiming ''anything,'' except to say, &quot;So-and-so argues that such-and-such,
twiddle dee dee, and therefore, QED.&quot;  This can be done with a straight
face, with no moral compunctions, because you are ''attributing'' the claim
to ''someone else.''  That's the important thing here!  If we are summing up
''human knowledge'' on a subject, in the sense above-defined, then you are
''leaving out'' important information when you ''omit'' so-and-so's
argument.

It's worth observing that, at least in the humanities, scholars are trained
so that, even when trying to prove a point, one must bring forth
counter-arguments that seem to disprove one's thesis, so that one can
explain why the counter-arguments fail.  Such scholarly training also gives
one a better knowledge of source material and what may have been rejected
over the years.  Something very much like the neutral point of view is just
an assumption (more or less) among scholars--if it isn't adhered to, or if
only those facts that prove a particular point are used, one might lose
one's position and reputation.

&lt;h3&gt;I have some other objection.  Where should I ask it?&lt;/h3&gt;

Before asking it, please review the links below.  The issues have been very
extensively covered before.  If you have some new contribution to make to
the debate, you could try /Talk.

'''Comments???'''

I like this a lot, Larry.  A couple of points where some expansion might be
required:

* The case where usefully writing articles depends on assuming, say, evolution (I wish I had a better example but it's the standout one) is correct.  I know we've had this discussion extensively - what was the position(s) at the end of the discussion?
* Could you throw in a specific warning about &quot;fanboy pages&quot;?  They are amongst the most common NPOV violations, and they get &lt;EM&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; tedious to cleanup.  --[[Robert Merkel]]

What's a &quot;fanboy page&quot;? --[[LMS]]

:A page, usually written by a newbie, about a band/computer game/movie/TV show that they personally love, that uses lots of hyperbolic adjectives giving a totally misleading impression of the sigificance and artistic merit of the individual.  For example, have a look at the first version of the article on the the computer game &quot;Xenogears&quot;. --[[Robert Merkel]]
----
* Should analysis, especially of creative works, be permitted? This borders on reviews and opinion, which some object to on NPOV grounds. For example, consider my long article on [[Leaf by Niggle]], my short entry for the computer game [[Myth]], and the initial entry (later removed) for TV show [[Friends]]. Is there a place in Wikipedia for such analysis? If so, should such analysis often/always include citations to authorities? And does this topic need to be addressed on the NPOV page? -- [[Cayzle]].

:Cayzle, my view would be that providing an overview of the common interpretations of a creative work, preferably with citations or references to notable individuals holding that interpretation, is appropriate. However, a personal analysis of a book or movie isn't NPOV and it's also not &quot;defined knowledge&quot; (as distinct from contemporary research). --[[Robert Merkel]]

:Good question.  I agree with Robert's response but will add more. --[[LMS]]
----
Overall, I think it covers things quite well. A few points off-hand:
*I didn't like the line drawn between ''we'' (Wikipedia old hands) and ''you'' (clueless newbie) in the first paragraph, so I re-worked it a bit. I'd like people to feel like they are part of the ''we'' of Wikipedia when they first arrive.
*The text rambles on a little. I cut it back a little, while still attempting to cover all the points and repeat key concepts. It could probably use a little more pruning. (But that's not to say that certain points shouldn't be expanded, as Robert and Cayzle suggest.)
*It seems to fairly sum up the various objects and counter-objects raises in the various (and volumnous) debates (like the ones on the current [[w:NPOV]] page, [[w:Creationism/Talk]], etc). However, it might be a good idea to provide links to those debates, and ask people to read through them ''first'' before raising objections to the NPOV policy. Most newcommers don't realize that amount of debate that this subject has generated in earlier days.
*There's one sentence that I just couldn't grok: ''&quot;This is, to be sure, something like this is well-established sense of the word &quot;knowledge,&quot; a sense in which what is &quot;known&quot; has changed considerably over the years.&quot;'' Clarification?
--[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

While a lot of the sentences can be tightened up and made &quot;punchier,&quot; the
general argument is, if anything, too brief.  I think what might strike you
as rambling is actually careful reasoning that a lot of people just have
never managed to wrap their minds around.  The ungrokkable sentence will be
clarified... --[[LMS]]
-----
Larry,
Overall good explanation for those who need the details.  A few points:
*I see NPOV as less of a rule and more of an art.  Don't know the best way to evangalize this.
*I agree that the text is a bit long and rambling.  Many of the people we're aiming this at may be knee-jerk reactionaries who tend to argue the first sentence they run into.  Better to be succinct if and where possible.
*One of the things that bugs me and isn't discussed is minor infrigments - for example recent article about Bob Dylan that talked about how great a musician he is and how these are some of his best works: I may agree with both but they don't read like an encyclopedia.  Bob Dylan is recognized as a great musician and many consider these works among his best - says the same thing but sounds less like opinion.
--[[justfred]]

I think it'll be good to have an executive summary, yes.  I'll write that.
Minor infringements--yes, I'll do that. --[[LMS]]
----
You need to give examples.  I read all that and it sounds fine, yet it
doesn't help me at all when the real case comes along.  As a lifetime
skeptic I often have opinions on issues that are the opposite of what the
majority have come to believe.  To take the example of Feminism, the
hostility to my comments was such that I abandoned the project for lack of
ability to resolve the differences.  [[David Byron]]  And oh yeah - make the
&quot;NPOV =/= one point of view, but both&quot; comment snappier from the beginning.

:Right, an example or two will help.  It'll be hard to give some that are both illuminating and about which people won't immediately say, &quot;Hey, but that ''is'' biased...&quot;  As to resolving differences, hey, don't abandon the project if you can't do it--just abandon that particular article.  It'll be there later when everybody's cooled off a bit.  But I would say that the best approach is to tell people, &quot;Hey, I want to make this article less biased.  Views X and Y are well-represented, and I want to work hard to make sure they continue to be well-represented.  But view Z also needs to be represented.  So, I've added information about that.&quot; --[[LMS]]
-----

Most of this article is terrific, and it is a good improvement over the
current Wikipedia entry on NPOV. Great work. But one section troubles me,
and troubles me deeply. I find the optimism about science vs. pseudo-science
to be baseless. History has shown that pseudo-science can beat out facts, as
those who rely on pseudo-science use lies, slander, innuendo and numercial
majorities of its followers to force their views on the anyone they can.

Is Wikipedia about representing knowledge, as an encyclopaedia should be? If
so, this part of the proposed NPOV policy is dangerous to the long term
academic integrity of the project.  The current NPOV article makes
Wikipedia's mission out &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; to be a summation of human knowledge, but
rather only a much less worthwhile task - it will be merely a summation of
human arguments. That is not a goal many scientists or historians will spend
their time on. They will simply refuse to contribute. That, you can be sure,
will not be the case for the millions of deluded and sometimes mean-spirited
people who promote and push pseudo-science and pseudo-history. They will
take advantage of this project. This may become more apparent as the project
progresses.

If this project gives equal validity to those who literally claim that the
Earth is flat, or those who claim that the Holocaust never occured, the
result is that it will (inadvertently) legitimize and help promote that
which only can be termed evil.  You don't debate (and therefore legitimize)
people who say the world is flat; you explain why science has proven it
isn't flat. You don't debate (and therefore legitimize) Jew-hating Nazis who
claim that the Holocaust didn't happen, or that all Zionists are part of a
conspirary to rule the world. You don't debate (and therefore legitimize)
misogynist fascist extremists who teach that homosexuals, liberals and
feminists are to blame for the World Trade Center Disaster. If Wikipedia
gives equal validity to these view, those who promote them will predominate,
and those who value obiective truth will leave the project to work on safer
projects, where their words will not be misused. [[RK]]

:I encourage you to read it again, RK. NPOV is not about giving equal validity to all views. You'll notice  &quot;...but, where there is any significant controversy, the different viewpoints in the controversy are each ''described fairly.''&quot; There is not significant controversy in the examples you provide. Thus, on the [[w:Holocaust]] page, it should be mentioned that there is a tiny number of people that it deny that it happened, but that this view is given no credit whatsoever by anyone outside of neo-nazi circles.  Such a statement is NPOV, and it certainly doesn't give the deniers equal weight. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

:What Stephen said.  The project does not give &quot;equal validity to those who literally claim that the Earth is flat.&quot;  See 3.2 and 3.3 (in the present numbering) above. --[[LMS]]
----
Thanks for the above comments.  I'll try to rewrite it so that it is a
little snappier, and one sentence just didn't parse at
all... --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
-----
While this is obviously a central issue to Wikipedia, this kind of attention
is, I believe, detrimental. The number of appeals to NPOV have been
increasing rapidly (e.g. statements such as &quot;Such a statement is NPOV&quot;). I
really believe that the NPOV should be held as a goal, but should never be
appealed to directly in an edit. In other words, if I write:

&quot;Tupac is the best rapper ever!&quot;

This comment should be deleted with a comment such as &quot;Claim of &quot;best rapper
ever&quot; made without supporting evidence, deleted&quot; instead of &quot;Deleted, not
NPOV&quot;, because it may actually be true, from a NPOV, that Shakur is the best
rapper ever.

or even better, edited to

&quot;Shakur was the first rapper to have two singles simultaneously in the
Billboard Top 10, and sold out stadium-size concerts for 10 years.&quot;

(I'm making that up. I have no idea.)

:If the appeals are ''legitimate,'' then this isn't a problem!  It's something that should be encouraged!  In fact, I have noticed considerably more bias in articles recently, and this is one main reason that I decided the issue needed to be clarified.  I think the main problem lately ''hasn't'' been that people have been abusing the notion of neutrality, but that they simply ''haven't understood it.''
:Basically, I'm all in favor of getting the point across as effectively as possible.  Simply describing an edit as &quot;not NPOV&quot; is often not helpful--I agree with that much.  It's better just to edit the text so that it's unbiased, without comment--yes.  If for whatever reason you don't want to edit the text but want to comment on the bias, you should always mention ''in what way'' it's biased.  But in any case, it's ''totally'' wrong to discourage people from taking other people to task over lack of bias.  It's how we teach each other this point of policy.

:What strikes me as ''really'' wrong is when people accuse each other of bias when they themselves just want the article to be biased in a different direction.  We should be working ''together'' to state each other's viewpoints as sympathetically as possible.  This will make everybody happier, because we'll be working on the same project, not competing with each other in a hostile atmosphere.

To repeat: I believe we should discuss the nature of NPOV as much as
possible, but never appeal to it directly as a justification for an edit. I
think this might be what justfred means by &quot;I see NPOV as less of a rule and
more of an art.&quot;

:To repeat, then: I completely disagree with this.  Referring to the policy is the way the policy gets taught.

I don't think it's necessary to encourage, as policy, individuals to cover
all the bases in an article--the collaborative process pretty much ensures
that it does.

:To some extent, yes.  But not always.  You, for example, have written a number of biased articles about news topics, Cunctator; no one has bothered to go in and de-bias them.  The problem will remain until someone does, and that could be a long time indeed.  If you had represented the opposition's biases as well as your own, the articles would be much better.  So I think we ''should'' make an effort to &quot;know the enemy&quot; by trying to state their views sympathetically.  We should encourage each other to do this.  It will make the articles stronger.

It's true we haven't fully resolved what happens when people with a strongly
held, idiosyncratic worldview are persistent editors, but for example, even
the vast majority of the HJ-edited articles are pretty reasonable, after
other people clean them out.

I believe the truth will out, simply by editing for clarity and
supportability.  I believe in making appeals to those precepts.

:So do I, very much so, and I do constantly.  But clarity and supportability are ''not'' enough.  There are many articles in Wikipedia that right now make many clear, supportable points--but which do not make the clear, supportable points that others might have on the issues.  This makes the articles rather less valuable, and undermines the credibility of Wikipedia.

Since no individual or single statement can be truly unbiased, why fight it?

:Well, that's simply false, and you disappoint by not explaining why you think as you do.  Please try to support it.  I suspect you're just laboring under a false interpretation of &quot;unbiased&quot;: ''do'' try to show me otherwise. It might lead to some interesting additions to the article.

::See below. You disappoint by not explaining why you think as you do.

:::Oh, this should be interesting.

Just encourage each individual to be clear and support their statements. The
Wikiprocess will clean out bias from there.

:That's not at all the direction in which I will try to encourage us.  I will encourage people not only to be clear and to support their statements, ''but also'' to try to represent their own and others' positions ''fairly.''

(I should say I don't totally believe this; I think individuals should try
to be unbiased, but I don't think official Wikipedia policy needs to
&quot;encourage&quot; them to do so. I think it's the type of thing each person should
develop for oneself.)
--[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

:In the end, you might be right about that on some level; but if we did not have an explicit policy, which was applied in particular cases (as opposed to just ignored, as you suggest), Wikipedia would be a complete hell hole of a flame fest.  Far nastier than things are right now.  I wouldn't want any part of that. --[[LMS]]

::I never suggest that it be ignored.

::: I'm referring to such claims as &quot;To repeat: I believe we should discuss the nature of NPOV as much as possible, but never appeal to it directly as a justification for an edit&quot; and &quot;I don't think it's necessary to encourage, as policy, individuals to cover all the bases in an article--the collaborative process pretty much ensures that it does.&quot;  It seems to me that that means that you think that we each, individually, would be safe to ignore the nonbias policy, both in attempting to apply it ourselves and in taking others to task for failing to apply it.  If we do not make an attempt to write in an unbiased fashion ourselves, and we do not take others to task for it, we are ''thereby'' ignoring the policy.  So what you were suggesting was tantamount to ignoring the policy.  Perhaps that explains my reaction to your suggestions, eh?  I think the nonbias policy is ''one of the most'' important policies for us to follow, and that our explicit, conscious following of it has been one of the reasons for Wikipedia's success so far. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

You '''definitely''' need a worked example.  I would suggest something that
people won't have a stake in like literally arguing the Earth is flat but I
see there's a serious article on that already.... and on the existence of
fairies.... angels on the head of a pin perhaps?

Here's an interesting example of a debate on the ''Encyclopedia of Arda''
which concerns whether or not Balrogs have wings (this is apparently a big
argument among totally fixated Tolkien fans?)

http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/b/balrogs.html  (scroll down for the debate).

However in this case the amount of evidence on both sides is fairly limited.
Is that a good model for issues where either side could probably go on
listing evidence ad nauseam?  Indeed to what extent is evidence and factual
support consistent with an encyclopedia view?  The description you use above
doesn't mention anything about '''who is right''' in an argument, presumably
because that's at issue.  However because you don't want to end up with,
say, Holocaust denial, having 50% weight you suggest weight '''in proportion
to member participation'''.  Is that a good idea?  With the rule that
factual content shouldn't be deleted but balanced you instead get a
weighting in proportion to '''how much people can be bothered to represent
each POV''' but that would lead to evidence bloat I would think.

:No, I think member participation doesn't matter at ''all.''  If we're trying to represent human knowledge, then in an article comparing different views on something, that naturally has some space limit, one gives more space to the view that's more popular ''among the experts who comment on the issue,'' or when it's not an &quot;expert's&quot; issue, among the concerned parties. I couldn't give a rat's patoot (oops, that phrase :-) ) what Wikipedians think.  I think Reid was probably the greatest Early Modern philosopher, but in this I am very unusual.  Should Wikipedia give some special weight to the opinion that Reid was probably the greatest Early Modern philosopher, ''just because'' I have that opinion?  Of course not.  Who ''cares'' what I think? 

An example from the [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Feminism| Feminism
page] again, there was some contention specifically about the dominance of
the movement by 'radical' feminists, so I felt obliged to put several
paragraphs of brief evidence about 'radical' feminist representation and
dominance which perhaps shouldn't be in an article.  In fact earlier the
article had some direct quotes which were later removed.  Unlike Balrog
wings many issues have had people fill books with the arguments for or
against.  [[David Byron]]

:Well, I think it's really important that we define what our articles are ''about.''  In this case, the topic is &quot;feminism,&quot; which includes both a philosophy and a movement.  What we might do is have a stub at &quot;feminism,&quot; which briefly defines the two strands and then points the reader to [[feminist philosophy]] (or, maybe better, [[feminist ideology]] or [[feminist thought]]) and [[the feminist movement]].  Then, in the latter article, of course in a characterization of the modern feminist movement, evidence about radical feminist representation would be ''very'' apropos. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

It somewhat frustrates me that LMS inlines his responses to my commentary,
but I suppose my comments are so freaking long that to do otherwise would be
difficult. The one assertion I want to respond to is his claim that it's
possible for an individual to be unbiased. To use his language, &quot;That's
simply false.&quot; Maybe I'm &quot;laboring under a false definition of 'unbiased'&quot;,
but I rather suspect, instead of bandying about who's laboring under truth
and who under falsehood, we might have different but both valid definitions.

:I don't care what your definition is, in this context.  Since we are talking about lack of bias, or neutrality, ''according to Wikipedia's policy,'' that there might be some ''other'' definition of &quot;bias&quot; according to which people are necessarily biased is both unsurprising and unimpressive. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I consider 'bias' to be equivalent to 'perspective' or 'subjectivity': a
point of view of a situation based on a particular conception of reality. It
is a tautology that an individual must have a subjective point of view. The
only way to be truly unbiased is to know everything. And omniscience is
pretty hard to come by.

An individual may, however, be able to approximate objectivity/unbias to the
satisfaction of a consensus of peers. This may be considered being
&quot;unbiased&quot; from a pragmatic perspective, but only from such a
perspective. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
:The following is very interesting and will result in some really good additions to the article, I think!

Quoting [[LMS]] from the Iran/Contra affair page,

&lt;i&gt;I have to say I am bothered a fair bit by those who constantly attempt to
represent their own views on politically charged topics, and they seem not
to care at all about whether other points of view are represented fairly.
Yes, that is your job. If you don't commit yourself to doing that, Wikipedia
will be much, much weaker for it. I think that's already the case, actually,
and I think it should stop. I think we should all be engaged in explaining
each other's points of view as sympathetically as possible!&lt;/i&gt;

Ok now you are going further and saying that people should present the other
POV at all times.

:Well, no.  I don't think I'm going further.  I think I'm explicitly spelling out what might have been obvious to some people (and was certainly obvious to me) from an initial reading of the policy.  If each of us ''individually'' is permitted to write totally biased stuff in our Wikipedia contributions, then how is it possible that the policy is ever ''violated''? The policy ''says,'' &quot;Go thou and write unbiasedly&quot; (or something to that effect).  If that ''doesn't'' entail that we should represent views with which you disagree fairly, then what ''does'' it mean?  Maybe you think it means, &quot;Represent your own view fairly, but if you must only ''grudgingly'' allow others to have a say, please allow them to do so.&quot;  Maybe that makes a bit of sense as an interpretation--not a lot, but a bit.  But consider, if we each take responsibility for ''the entire'' article when we hit that &quot;save&quot; button, then when we make a change to an article that represents ''our own'' views but not contrary views, or represents contrary views unfairly or incompletely (etc.), surely we are adding bias to Wikipedia. And does it really ever make sense ''not'' to take responsibility for the entire article?  Does it make sense to prise out sentences and say, &quot;These are mine, those are yours&quot;?  Perhaps, but in the context of a project that is so strongly and explicitly committed to neutrality, that sort of attitude seems totally out of place!

On contentious issues (and on non-contentious issues this all moot) this
won't work because the other 'side' isn't going to buy that you presented
their ideas correctly, and in any case it seems clear that if you beleive X
is not true, you are not going to be able to present an argument for it,
unless you feel that argument is flawed.

:The other side might very well find your attempts substandard, but it's the thought that counts.  In resolving disputes over neutrality issues, it's far better that we acknowledge that all sides must be presented fairly, and make at least a college try at presenting the other sides fairly.  That will be appreciated much more than not trying at all.

:: I suggest that its more likely that the other side will see you as deliberately setting up straw men to be knocked down, leading to resentment and more accusations.  That has happened at the Feminism page.  And how can your rendition of their argument be anything but straw?  After all if it held weight (from your POV) then you wouldn't be opposing it.  At least my own thinking tends to be that watertight.... [[David Byron]]

:::My experience on Wikipedia has been different.  In the past, when people have worked together to make sure a controversial article state all points of view fairly (which ''hasn't'' been the case with the feminism article lately), while there is still some partisan rancor, at least people ''have'' seemed to share a common goal.  This is how the articles on capitalism, socialism, abortion, and a number of other topics developed, I think.

Should people really add deliberately flawed arguments to an article?

:I doubt that anyone makes ''deliberately flawed'' arguments.  I think what you mean is: should we add arguments that we believe are flawed to Wikipedia, so that our adding would make it seem as if we were adding ''deliberately'' flawed arguments?  No, we add the ''best'' (published) arguments of the opposition, preferably citing some prominent person who has actually made the argument in the form in which you present it, stating them as sympathetically as possible.  Philosophers do this all the time.

:: Well feminists are not philosophers and although I know what arguments feminists commonly use, I could not in good conscience repeat them because they are lies.  (See later - your Holocaust denial example) [[David Byron]]

:::David, what on earth are you talking about?  There are a lot of feminist philosophers.  They have arguments.  It is important that we present them in their best light.  They aren't ''lies'': they are ''arguments''!  Jeez!  What is the big deal???

::::Obviously I cannot reply without a specific statement to consider. You're turning this into a discussion of feminism not the NPOV.

:::::Look, you said that we shouldn't add flawed arguments to Wikipedia.  I pointed out the obvious: that in an encyclopedia we should cite (important, influential) arguments by prominent people, stated sympathetically.  This is important information to include in an encyclopedia.  Philosophers (and other people) are constantly explaining arguments that they personally think are flawed.  You replied, incoherently and irrelevantly, that feminists aren't philosophers and that their arguments are &quot;lies.&quot;  This basically was unresponsive to my point.

To take it further, on the topic of Feminism I do know all the arguments
feminists usually use on issues, but most of them rely on stating as fact
many things which are false.  Are you saying NPOV means I must lie in an
article to faithfully represent the POV I disagree with?

:No, you're just misunderstanding what the neutrality policy says.  ''You'' aren't claiming ''anything,'' except to say, &quot;So-and-so (Catherine McKinnon, or someone) argues that such-and-such, twiddle dee dee, and therefore, QED.&quot; This can be done with a straight face, with no moral compunctions, because you are ''attributing'' the claim to someone else.  That's the important thing here!  If we are summing up ''human knowledge'' on a subject, in the sense above-defined, then you are ''leaving out'' important information when you omit so-and-so's argument.

:: That's not true.  If you say &quot;so and so says such and such fact&quot; and leave it at that when such and such fact is garbage, that is not a good article, even if its true that so and so says it. Left unanswered the implication is that the such and such is true.

:::David, this is getting ridiculous, because you're failing to grasp the most basic points.  When, in giving an exposition of what ''someone else'' thinks, one does not, thereby, imply that ''what'' that other person thinks ''is true.''  That's silly!  If I say, &quot;The Greeks believed that man is a rational animal,&quot; I do not thereby imply that ''I'' think that man is a rational animal, nor do I imply that, in fact, man is a rational animal.  This is just the nature of exposition, which any educated person is perfectly well aware of.

Perhaps you could give an example of how you would faithfully represent the
POV that the Holocaust never happened, or that the Earth is literally flat?
[[David Byron]]
:(for example) There is a significant minority of people who believe that the earth is in fact flat, and that upon passing the boundary of the horizon, ships and the people on them will fall off and be eaten by dragons. This view is generally considered to disagree with generally accepted scientific findings; more information may be found at [[Earth/Flat earth]]. The subject of whether the universe rests upon the backs of an infinite progression of turtles is considered controversial as well.
----
I think that those are extreme examples, David.  Moreover, I think it's
somewhat counterproductive to bring them up as if they are the norm.  I
won't discuss feminism with you here, but would like to use your own
example, if I may.  In the feminism discussion, you often asserted that
feminists believed X, when X was in fact false, and then said that the
pro-feminist (in the looser use of the term) side needed to provide evidence
if they wanted to make those claims.  HOWEVER, because you &quot;knew&quot; that you
were right, you never offered the same evidence to support what you &quot;knew&quot;.

: I did on many ocassions. But no feminist did. That is a clear distinction. Moreoever this is a distinction which holds not just here but with feminists I've talked to on-line for several years. Like the Flat Earth view, there is no credible defence of some ideas. What then? Do I hint that Feminism is as silly as believing in dragons and gargantuan turtles as you did with the Flat Earthers? At any rate whatever your feelings about Feminism, if there is a case when there is no evidence or argument for a view point but people still support that view point, what then?  [[David Byron]]

::David, if you honestly think that feminism has no more credibility than belief in dragons, then I would ask you please not to work on any articles connected to feminism.  Working on Wikipedia requires that you can treat others' views with respect, sympathetically, even if you disagree (strongly!) with them.

:::*Sigh* YOU said &quot;dragons&quot; not me. Maybe you need to quit the project? As for feminism since you clearly cannot prevent yourself from over-personalising that issue I suggest we go back to Flat Earth or the Holocaust for illustrations. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid by picking a dummy issue. [[David Byron]]

::::Er, no, David, ''you'' said &quot;dragons&quot; and I quote: &quot;Like the Flat Earth view, there is no credible defence of some ideas. What then? Do I hint that Feminism is as silly as believing in dragons and gargantuan turtles as you did with the Flat Earthers?&quot;  This, in the context of the discussion, seems clearly to imply that you think feminism has no more credibility than belief in dragons.  If that's ''really'' your view, then even other anti-feminists must question your judgment.  And, David, the only issue I'm &quot;personalizing&quot; is the neutral point of view.  You don't know whether or not I'm a feminist.  I get far more upset by people who try to fill Wikipedia--a project that I started--with their unfair, silly, partisan screeds.  And then waste people's time arguing about them.

I think that, if that particular article were to be represented in a truly
NPOV, you should actually say something like 'feminists assert X, but those
who see no need for feminism point out that evidence Y disproves this'.
Again , I hope you are not offended by my using you as an example -- it is
just that I have read most of the debate recently.

:Well, the latter solution is OK but could be reworded like this: &quot;feminists assert X, but those who see no need for feminism point out that, in their opinion, evidence Y disproves this.&quot;  We have to be sensitive to &quot;de re&quot;/&quot;de dicto&quot; issues: if we say that anti-feminists ''point out that p,'' it sounds as if ''we'' believe that ''p,'' when officially we take no stand on ''p.'' (When you &quot;point something out,&quot; usually you're pointing to something we can all observe and agree to.  When you &quot;state an opinion,&quot; you are using words that others might or might not agree with.)

:: Ok let me try. ''Neo-Nazis assert that no Jews were executed in death camps, but those who see no need for Neo-Nazis point out that in their opinion, some Jews were executed.''  I think if I said this every two minutes the text would be very awkward and people would be just as annoyed and just as likely to say their POV was unrepresented.

:::What is your attempt to sum up the holocaust denial view in a sentence intended to ''prove''?  That we cannot sum up controversial views (and criticisms thereof) in a sentence?  You're not making any sense.

::::Current article is theoretical and abstract. But when controversy arises it doesn't much help IMO. That is what it is supposed to 'prove'

:::::I can't parse those sentences.

The last part of the paragraph leads me to what I see as one of the biggest
problems with encouraging people to ''write from a '' (not be) NPOV.  THe
very existence of the WIkipedia seems to be based on the very valid
assumptions that anybody can be an expert on something, and that you don't
have to be a trained scholar to be an expert.  I believe this
wholeheartedly.

At the same time, I believe that scholarly training (at least in the past 75
years or so) is very useful.  At least in the Humanities, that training
dictates that, even when trying to prove a point, one must bring forth
examples that seem to disprove one's argument, so that one can explain why
they don't fit in.

: But an encyclopedia is not a debate. If no one holds these arguments then why mention them? For example I myself can raise better defences of feminism than any I've heard from a feminist. So what? It's still wrong. Again with the Flat Earth thing I could argue that ships disappearing over horizons were due to mirage like effects bending the light. But if no '''actual''' Flat Earther says this, why bother with this clutter? [[David Byron]]

::David, again, given that this is your view, I'm asking you please to stop working on articles related to feminism.  Yes, of course an encyclopedia isn't a debate.  An encyclopedia can and should give an account of how important, prominent debates among academics (and public figures, and sometimes among others) have proceeded, though.  That is important information to be included in an encyclopedia, ''regardless'' of your opinion of it.  I, for example, would like to have a better acquaintance with the details of the arguments of feminists.  I frankly could not care less about ''your'' opinions of those arguments.  I want those arguments stated clearly and fairly.

::: This is an example of what I mean when I say that many people passionately hold certain positions (such as yours with feminism it seems- from your reaction here) which they are utterly unable to defend. I asked you to give an example of how to treat controversial subjects. When you replied with ''Flat Earth'' I gave the equivalent in ''Feminism'' but your reaction to both is quite different because you happen to beleive in the one but not the other. THUS you know nothing or little about a topic but are unwilling to let your own ignorance prevent you from comment on what others do. Don't you think that's quite dangerous? Now I suggest to try and quit over-personalising this you just take as a hypothesis that there exist issues where one side passionately beleives something but has no evidence for their arguments. Believe me this happens even if you don't happen to agree it's true of feminism. For example any propaganda beleifs such as the Nazi government's &quot;International Jewish Conspiracy&quot;. Do you honestly beleive there was ever a ''debate'' about this concept? Do you beleive there were ''arguments''? Reasoning? or should we just do what you did with the ''Flat Earth'' example and simply say &quot;some people beleive X but then they probably beleive in dragons too&quot;.

::::It is rapidly becoming blindingly obvious to me that it is a complete waste of time trying to argue with you.  David, I think you really ''should'' take a break from the project. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Training also gives one a better knowledge of source material and what may
have been rejected over the years.  Finally, NPOV is just an assumption
(more or less) among scholars -- if it isn't adhered to, or if only those
facts that prove a particular point are used, one might lose one's position
and reputation.  This is I think one of the sources of frustration over
NPOV -- there are a bunch of people out there who have NPOV ingrained in
them, and a bunch that, although they know their stuff, have never been
forced to look at an issue from all sides.

:I think this hits the nail on the head!  Well said!

:: I'll beleive it when I see someone write a creditable Flat Earth POV or Holocaust POV that doesn't simply say &quot;XXX beleive this, but they're wrong.&quot; [[David Byron]]

:::I don't know why we should care about the confusion of someone who doesn't even know how to spell &quot;believe.&quot;  You should probably just sit back and watch for a little longer before joining in again, David. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

::::Oh THAT is really constructive and adult behaviour isn't it. Well that tells me all I need to know about how much input you want on this article.

::::::Apologise for the stupid remarks and the other many insults you've leveled at me and I will continue to discuss this article which you asked for input on. My opinion of you is that you don't really want anyone's views if they contradict your own. Hell - I wasn't even contradicting you. Whatever..... [[David Byron]]

:::::I welcome ''intelligent, informed'' disagreement.  I haven't seen that from you.  I also meant what I said: I think you should take a break from the project altogether, not because you disagree with me, of course, but because you have amply demonstrated an inability even to understand this very basic, but essential policy.  In short, if you have correctly described your beliefs, then whenever you write on any subject about which you have similar feelings as you do toward feminism, you'll be utterly incapable of writing from a neutral point of view.  We should not be wasting our time dealing with someone who doesn't want to play by our rules.--Of course, if it were clear to me that you both ''understood'' the neutrality policy and had a legitimate criticism of it, I would not be at all hostile.  But your criticisms simply betray a failure to understand the policy you're trying to criticize, and probably more importantly, they betray an attitude that demonstrates that you cannot collaborate with others fairly.  We don't need such a person working on this project. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Rambling, I know...sorry, all.  What I find very frustrating is that many
Wikipedians don't take the time to get to know each other and what has gone
before, so that they can at least try to make valid judgements.  There is an
awful lot of &quot;I don't care -- I know I'm right&quot; going on.

:Hear, hear.  ''And,'' it hasn't always been that way.  It's only been a problem as serious as it has been for about, say, the last couple of months. Of course, there was plenty of partisan rancor in the past, but at least people would try to ''some'' extent to hammer out an unbiased presentation of a debate.  Now, it seems like people have become more firmly entrenched. I think it has to stop!

Check out the Galileoo debate for some prime examples.  I don't think that a
college degree makes a wikipedian impervious to the bullshit bug -- nor do I
think it makes a person better or smarter, but if this is supposed to be a
community, shouldn't we as members respect others areas of expertise just a
bit?  And shouldn't there be some kind of agreement that, if you put
something up as fact, you be able to support it, rather than putting it up
and then saying that nonone can remove it till they DISprove it? ...just my
thoughts on the subject.

:I agree! --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Thank goodness for that...(agree with you on the feminist thing, too) now, I
think something needs to be done, because right now I'm watching someone who
has until recently been a very useful contributor turning into a real
bonafide troll -- mostly, I think because of the atmosphere that is becoming
more prevalent.  In order to make things &quot;right&quot;, Taw has decided to
redirect all of HJ's entries to the appropriate Polish names --
even though LDC and others have pointed out to them both that sometimes one
name is appropriate FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS, and sometimes the other (and
sometimes, as in medieval Danzig and modern Gdansk, both are correct -- in
context).   This wouldn't be a big problem, except that, once something is
re-directed, regular wiki people can't put it back...

:You can always change a redirect.  Click on the &quot;redirected from&quot; link at the top of the page!

Larry Sanger says '''I welcome intelligent, informed disagreement.  I haven't seen that from you.'''

That's sad Larry because you were just telling us all how ''as a professional philospher'' you are trained to be able to fairly sumarize the other guy's point of view. But your attempts to do so here with my views seem less than stellar don't they? [[David Byron]]

Larry has now claimed that, &lt;i&gt;I do reserve the right to tell people to get lost, if necessary--if I am convinced that they are unequivocally a burden to the project. I've done so once before. (That person has come back and has become a relatively productive member, I'm happy to say.) I am one of two people who are paid to work on this project, which I started, and I'm the closest thing there is to an administrator for the project. I imagine you might not have known all this, which is fine. Now you do.&lt;/i&gt;

Can anyone tell me if this is correct? I thought this was a community project. Did Larry just stage a coup here?
----
David, get a grip.  This ''is'' a community project.  The fact that one member of the community also exercises administrative functions--such as telling people to get lost, if necessary--does not make it any ''less'' a community project.  This is not about me.  This is about you and your rejection of one of the basic principles of this community.  If you can't abide by it, indeed, I'm going to tell you to leave.  If you can, though, I'll be very happy to ask you to stay. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

:I do not wish to hear any more from you Larry. I want to hear from others. If Larry Sanger says that he reserves the right to exclude anyone from the project simply on a personal grudge, then this is not a community project. 

:Just to put this in perspective Larry threatened to bar me saying I was biased and didn't understand the NPOV.

::Boy, David, you do make it difficult to ignore you, because you're constantly saying things about me that are totally unfair and misleading.  I wouldn't dream of barring someone ''just because'' he's biased.  Nearly all of us have quite evident biases.  I ''would'' bar someone because he explicitly vows to write biased stuff, however, because (in my opinion) he doesn't understand the nonbias policy--and I'll defend that decision, too!

:I had to point out to him that I have been carefult to edit NO ARTICLES in the last 2 weeks just so as to avoid that exact criticism. Larry didn't even know that because he was so sure that my (non-existant)editing was biased, based on nothing but his inability to communciate on this page, that he never bothered to check. Way to go!!

::All I can say is, I'm glad to learn I was wrong and I'm glad to learn that your judgment, that it would be a mistake to make edits when you realize you can't write unbiased text, served you well.

:I see no conflict here. If Larry has this much abusive power I'll leave before he can give me the boot. If he doesn't then he can go screw himself and I'll continue to contribute. So I would like to know whether he has this authoriity or not.

::Yes, I do.  (Moreover, I would be the person to ask about this.)  But I don't intend to use it unless you really do become a problem.  If all you do is continue to kvetch on commentary and /Talk pages, that's very annoying, but it isn't grounds to ban someone.  Also, if you make an effort to write from a neutral point of view, even if you don't do a perfect job of it, I'll have no grounds on which to bar you.

&lt;i&gt;David, sorry to let you in on this not-so-secret fact, but yeah, I'm pretty sure that Larry and Jimbo have the right to block you.  That said, nothing I have seen in the past several months that I've been involved makes me think that this would be done, or accepted by the others in the community, without consideration.  Part of this is because the community is just that -- or was until recently.  Other members would defend you, if they thought Larry were wrong -- sort of an organic checks and balances system.  This is pretty much proven by the fact that only shows that Larry doesn't abuse this power.  In fact, since i've been here, there have been very loud debates on Larry and his role, with some of the most prolific and respected Wikipedians disagreeing with Larry.  Perhaps it would serve you well to read around and get a sense of how people feel before making threats.

The sad thing is that there are others around who have left or are considering leaving or will eventually leave because they are just too tired of duking it out with people who don't like the way the Wikipedia works rather than producing something worthwhile.&lt;/i&gt;

:That's definitely the strong impression I've had since arriving here. But this is the first time I've been threatened, (you mistakenly said I was the one who threatened someone else????) not by any community of course, but by one person. However if you and others share the view that Larry can kick out anyone he wants then say so.

::It seems you missed JHK's point when she wrote: &quot;they are just too tired of duking it out with people who don't like the way the Wikipedia works rather than producing something worthwhile.&quot;  By &quot;they,&quot; she means herself, for example and by &quot;people who don't like the way the Wikipedia works,&quot; she means, well, you, for example.  And I agree 100% with her.  This is a very serious problem that I wish I could solve.  We ''don't'' want to lose any more good people!

&lt;i&gt;Before that happens, I would frankly hope that Jimbo and Larry pull the plug on the project -- which they can do, legally.  There are plenty of places on the web to post opinions; there are few where anyone can hone his skills at writing neutral, informative pieces on something they personally find interesting.  If what you want is the former, then I fervently hope you won't find it here.  If what you want is the latter, perhaps you should stop whinging and try to play nice with the other kids.  Yours is not the only ball on the playground. [[JHK]], who misses the wikipedia terribly, but not this kind of crap.&lt;/i&gt;

::Julie, there is no earthly force that would impel me to pull the plug on the project just because there are people not playing nice.  If I have to play the nasty old playground mom, as much as I the job, I will.  Also, I think you're wrong that we could pull the plug on Wikipedia.  If we stopped working on it for whatever reason, I hope very much that someone else would keep it going...our license legally obligates us to let people do so! --[[LMS]]

&lt;i&gt;Oh, and by the way, David, as a historian and as a human, I find your constant citing of Holocaust revisionism pretty damned repugnant.&lt;/i&gt;

: Well blame Jimmy the other admin guy for that one.

&lt;i&gt;I don't for a minute assume that you are in that particular camp, but the fact that you use that extreme an example to try to prove your point is an example of sinking to some fairly murky moral and ethical depths.  But, since you asked, yeah, there is a place for Holocaust revisionism on the 'pedia.  Its main exponents and tenets should be elucidated -- but that same article would have to mention that there was a recent libel case in London where a professor who accused a revisionist of being a liar, etc. and was sued, proved her case.  It would also have to mention any governmental and ecclesiatic (if they exist) rejections of the theory.  It might seem like bias, because the weight of evidence for the 'Holocaust existed' side is far greater. But if it provided information and supporting arguments on both sides, it would (I'm pretty sure) fulfill the NPOV requirement.  Still, you might find a more tasteful way of attempting to prove your point.&lt;/i&gt;

:If you read the above you will see that Larry specifically rejects the idea that facts have a part to play in a Wikipedia article. He would claim that unless some well know anti-Holocaust-revisionist had actually used the argument you mention, and not just you using your own argument, then the facts are irrelevent. But not consistently of course - I think it would basically depend on LSPOV.

::Oh, boy.  You need to take a little remedial reading comprehension course, don't you?  No, I did not say that facts don't &quot;have a part to play&quot; in a Wikipedia article about Holocaust revisionism.  Good lord. --[[LMS]]

Ok, I'm pretty much convinced this place is a grand waste of time. If Larry is in charge and willing to abuse his authority then I'm out of here. (And if he is in charge then he already has abused his authority in threatening me)

Larry -- Mea Culpa for the pulling the plug bit -- I mistakenly assumed that, since Jimbo owned the servers and employed you, that was a possibility.  Didn't think about the IP -- although if you did give up, someone else would have to be willing to commit the time and expense of new servers, etc.

David -- I actually did refer to your threat -- not to Larry's.  You threatened you would leave --&quot;If Larry has this much abusive power I'll leave before he can give me the boot.&quot; Sorry if I was not clear enough. --

(My apologies if I muck this up, long time reader first time poster and all that) Is there a reason that any and all of the linkages on this page (in it's draft form) fail to actually lead to their intended destinations?  In trying to follow the arguments I attempted to check the various examples being used and had to manually type them or cut/paste them to get to the (I'm presuming) intended wikipidia page. --[[user:Dublos|Dublos]]


Message from Pr Jean-Pierre Petit, phd, from France. 
Fields : fluids mechanics, physics, magnetohydrodynamics, theoretical astrophysics, cosmology, geometry ( I'm 69...). Today's science arises a big problem. What's solid science and what's not ? What can be considered a well established ( example : Maxwell equations ) and what should be considered as speculative work ( for example : superstring theory ). I suggest one can use a colour based coding. Black would be devoted, for example, to solid scientific facts, well established since a long time. Other would refer to different kinds of talks. For example violet could be associated to purely speculative papers. This problem of coding through colors should deserve a discussion among the wikipedia community. Presently, many visions are really nothing but speculative views. The people should be warned about what is speculative and what is not or ... less speculative ( if this word has a real meaning ).

I have had some (bad) experience, trying to contribute to Wikipedia free encyclopedia.  I fully agree with your choice : everybody must sign with his real name. At any time anybody can get the background of a writer, or expert. From this point of view Wikimedia is a great hope for us. The last one, I would say. To contact me directly ( I apologize for my poor english ) jppetit1937@yahoo.fr

I am reading a great book on logic, &lt;i&gt;Being Logical&lt;/i&gt;, D. Q. McInerny. McInerny very clearly articulates the first principles of logic, and it seemed only logical to try and define our own NPOV first principles. Thus I propose something along these lines. (Material adapted from the above mentioned book, however, it is also expressive of common understandings of writing style.)
*A NPOV uses precise language.
:Precise language uses words that correspond directly to the idea they express.
*A NPOV uses a clear topic for each article
:A single topic clarifies the subject being described.
*A NPOV avoids making evaluative statements.
:Evaluative statements express a subjective element in the description of an objective fact.
*A NPOV avoids unreferenced categorical statements.
:Categorical Statements express truth.
*A NPOV prefers particular to universal statements.
:Particular statements have a defined scope.
*A NPOV prefers description to summary.
:Description references source materials rather than synthesizing them.

Just some thoughts. I think that the power of the policy is in its postive aspects, rather than negative. I hope that these might accurately reflect the ideas that we propose. I suggest this as a kind of introduction that centers the policy, but does not wholly define it. The language I chose is again taken from McInery particularly and writing style in general.

I saw on a Talk page that someone invited a friend to take part in
Wikipedia. It seems that it might be helpful to add a link to the
header or footer of each article ( Talk pages as well? ) allowing
to send via e-mail the article with a suitable comment to a friend.

What do others think ?
----
Sounds cool to me and also seems easy to implement.  Does anyone see any potential for abuse in such a system?  Should there be a limit, say someone could only send three articles per day?

--[[user:Chuck_Smith|Chuck_Smith]]
----
Yep, I like it, on first glance!  Spam safeguards would be nice, yes. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
Let's move on to the implementation phase of the idea. right ?
----
Why not?  Run it by the Wikipedia-L folks, just to get their input.  (I don't think this is ''necessary'', but it wouldn't be a bad idea.) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

{{Historical}}
January 3, 2002, 1:26 PM -- A very quick column here.  I am curious about your opinion, and whether my attitude on an issue is generally shared.

On the one hand, I think it is a grand thing that Wikipedia is so open.  That explains Wikipedia's growth and even, to some extent, its quality (many editors).  It's important that we feel we can edit any article--within, of course, the general constraints of Wikipedia's community norms, as hopefully codified on the &quot;Wikipedia policy&quot; page.  If an expert in some subject comes along and wants to own an article and prevent others from working on it, so much the worse for the expert (since he'd just be wrong about Wikipedia policy) and for us (since he won't contribute to the project).

On the other hand, I think most of us believe that actual experts, when talking about their areas of expertise, generally have little patience with nonexperts holding forth at any length, and even less patience for conversation and debate with nonexperts.  They have, they think--and they're probably right--better things to do with their time.  They believe their training and knowledge entitles them to be treated with particular respect, at least when they are writing about their area of expertise, and at least by people who do not have their expertise.  And most of us accord them that respect, and think that others ought to do so.

So, I think there is a natural tension between, on the one hand, Wikipedia's openness, and on the other hand, the fact that most of us think we should politely defer to experts when they're writing about their areas of expertise.

But what about those uncomfortable cases in which the expert ''also'' has little respect for some essential aspect of Wikipedia policy, or is a &quot;rogue expert&quot;--e.g., when he insists on reporting on his own research (when it is not very important, or when other research is woefully underrepresented), or when he uses Wikipedia to grind his own ax (in violation of the neutrality policy)?

My view is that in this sort of case, it would be ideal (though we shouldn't expect to live up to the ideal always) if we would make a special point to treat the rogue expert with respect--not descending to anger, coldness, rage, condescension, etc.--while taking care to present those points of Wikipedia's policy that the rogue expert is violating in their best light.  The goal is to keep the expert on board while making a convert to the policy.  We might not be able to do either--but it's worth a try.

:Tough call, Larry...just to play devil's advocate, what if the rogue expert is an expert in something that is at best a pseudoscience?  I agree that politeness is important, but i think some of the recent &quot;rogues&quot; have been putting out research that really isn't -- it's just  an attempt to force through an acceptance of a rant.

:In general, though, I think that you're right.  I also hope that the general feeling out there is that even experts can still learn...it's the balance that I think is so difficult to find.  This difficulty is compounded when you start to think about the fact that people who tend to achieve real expertise in something tend to learn other things equally well, because they've mastered the learning process.  Thre are people working on the site who are bona fide experts in several fields -- and still they can't convince the axe grinders.  I think where people get frustrated is not so much in a lack of respect for an expert opinion (although that's part of it), as the fact that there are a huge number of discussions that turn on appropriate sources and methodology --  there seems to be a huge lack of respect for actual evidence, the use of legitimate sources, knowledge of current trends, and (ack!) scholarship.  Most of the people who have acquired their expertise via an academic career are USED to people arguing with, criticizing, and correcting them, for Pete's sake! I don't think it's the argument, it's the lack of respect for the work put into getting there. 

:There also seems to be a trend of people writing articles, not with supporting evidence, but with the very disrespectful attitude of &quot;prove me wrong -- you find the evidence, if you disagree.&quot; Of course, this usually comes from rogue experts, so....I guess I've come full circle ;-)

:Anyway, that's how I see it, but take it with a grain of salt, because I'm still pretty disillusioned.  I think you're absolutely right in that there needs to be more of a spirit of true collegiality and respect, or we'll lose valuable people.  But I also think there should be some mechanism to prevent reversion wars and the like  -- I just don't know how that would work without making LS look like a dictator in some people's eyes, or adding fuel to the idea that there are cliques and cabals at work.  

:You can't force people to know their neighbors -- but maybe you could encourage it through a pop-up page for first-timers that actually forces (in a programming sense) a series of guideline screens before allowing an edit.  It wouldn't appear if the user has logged in (after the first time).  Also, I think that it would be great to encourage people to put more about themselves (or at least their interests) on their pages -- that way, a person could check out where the other wikipedian is coming from BEFORE jumping all over them.  Lordy -- run on and on and on again... sorry all, it's a touchy point -- that's why I passed the salt! [[JHK]]

-----

I think the key point in dealing with academic experts is a) if they do demonstrate expert knowledge in a topic, not try to deny it, but b) point out that Wikipedia is not the forum for axe-grinding or debating contemporary research.  If they are unable or unwilling to do so, what kind of academic experts are they, anyway?  --[[Robert Merkel]]

----
This is not directly related to the debate, but I'd like to comment on a couple of the sentences above.

&quot;''I think most of us believe that actual experts, when talking about their areas of expertise, generally have little patience with nonexperts holding forth at any length, and even less patience for conversation and debate with nonexperts.  They have, they think--and they're probably right--better things to do with their time.''&quot;

I beg to disagree with the last sentence. I believe perhaps the most important aspect of Wikipedia in terms of long-term usefulness is to  make knowledge ''accessible'' to learners who want it. For this to become a reality it is necessary that experts acquire (through theory and practice) skills for communicating to a larger public. This would include, for instance, learning how to explain in simple terms why laymen's preconceptions or alternative theories are considered inadequate. So, with an eye towards favoring knowledge propagation, it seems to me that (respectful!) dialogue with nonexperts is a very good thing for an expert to do with his time, especially if the dialogue becomes public record, so that potentially many people can benefit from it. --[[Seb]]
----
Seb, you've got a good point.  If I, a nonexpert about (for example) bioinformatics, were to read an article about bioinformatics and find a number of points confusing, that could be made clear to me, conversation about ''that'' with a bioinformatics expert would be very useful (it would result in an improved article).  So I'd have to limit my claim to one about conversation and debate with nonexperts ''about the merits and accuracy of various views in their area of expertise''--as long as we can put the very legitimate concerns about bias aside for the moment.  Suppose a student who has read a little about epistemic circularity as part of their first class in epistemology comes along and wants to revise my (as yet unwritten!) article on that subject.  When I point out numerous errors in the revisions, I (who could probably be considered an expert about epistemic circularity) should not be expected to spend inordinate amounts of time arguing with the student--again, as long as I am not pushing my own idiosyncratic view of epistemic circularity.

The fact that people of all levels of knowledge about many different subjects are working together more or less as equals on the project does ''not'' mean all of their opinions on all subjects are of equal weight.  If my old dissertation adviser, an expert on George Berkeley, shows up and points out that Berkeley believed such-and-such, then, unless we've got ''good'' reason to dispute this, we should just nod our virtual heads in agreement (for now).  This is just common sense, but sometimes common sense needs to be spelled out! --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:1.25em;&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt; Less talk more shop? &lt;b&gt;[http://shop.wikimedia.org http://shop.wikimedia.org]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 10% discount during the Community Launch phase with CLAUNCH at checkout. Don't forget to come back and let us know what you thought! &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Goal ==

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to be able to provide affordable high quality merchandise to the project volunteers and the general public to reward its volunteers and spread the Wikimedia and project brands around the world. To that effect we want to build a wide reaching store that is able to provide good value and fast shipping around the world with the help of a world wide distribution system and the Wikimedia Chapters. The revenues from the store will support the Wikimedia Foundation and the chapters with most of it, especially at the beginning, going to subsidize merchandise and/or shipping for more expensive locales and to provide free merchandise to world wide volunteers as a reward and thank you for their service.

== What is this page for? ==

The logistics of creating a world wide shop to serve a community (of editors, donors and readers) as diverse as ours is an enormous task. We wanted to get the process out in the open as quickly as possible so that we can involve the community for feedback and advice throughout the process. We also wanted to allow the community to use the store as quickly as possible. The community can help find bugs in the system from top to bottom and notice where things should be tweaked as we go through the Beta process before we market it to the public. 

We are looking for feedback on basically everything about the process. 

* What do you like about what's for sale? 
* What else do you want for sale? Is there information that's missing that you think should be there? Changes to packaging or automated order/shipping emails? Quality of goods? 

Any part of the process is able to change at this point and we want to get it as perfect as possible so that customers (both within the editing community and outside of it) can get the high quality experience they expect from our projects.

== Call for designs ==

We want your designs! Go to [[/Design ideas]] page to give your ideas. We don't want to flood the shop with 'too much' but we want to be able to keep a constantly fresh variety of products (constantly more available and eventually some just going away) so we need ideas from everyone on what should be 'the next generation'. Product ideas (without specific designs) can go on to the main [[Talk:Merchandise|discussion page]] for now.

== Shop Advisory Committee ==

The whole idea of this store is to be able to reward the community and get our awareness out (and, not really, to make money) so we also want to make sure to have as much community input and hands in it as we possibly can. Because of that we're setting up an advisory committee. The advisory committee will:

* Give feedback, opinions and ideas about the shop itself, the product etc.
* Help reach out to the community to gather their feedback (and make them aware)
* Help with the strategic planning of the store:
** Launch communications both now and for the public launch
** Community Merch giveaway plans and execution (As part of this they would likely be ineligible for normal giveaways themselves). 
** What do we need? What should we release? Financials/costs etc?

Hopefully we would have a core group of at least 6-12 people interested in what's happening who can help us as we move forward. Are you interested? Sign up on the [[Talk:Wikimedia merchandise#Shop Advisory Committee|Talk page!]]

== FAQ == 

&lt;center&gt; ''' Do you have a question about the store that isn't answered here? Please feel free to add it or ask on the talk page ''' &lt;/center&gt;

=== OK, where is it? ===

The store is located at [http://shop.wikimedia.org http://shop.wikimedia.org]. Please feel free to poke around and, if you want, order something. It should be fully operational and we're trying to tweak things as we go along (everything from the shipping labels/packaging to the products to the site). If you have any feed back please let us know on the [[Talk:Merchandise|Discussion page]] or at merchandise{{@}}wikimedia.org (logged-in users can also use the email user function for [[Special:EmailUser/Jalexander|User:Jalexander]]).

To help out:

* We are offering an initial 10% store discount for at least the next 2 weeks of the Community Launch - use this promotion code at checkout: CLAUNCH 
* $10 Maximum shipping for most shipments worldwide (under '5lbs' of merchandise, I'm hacking together a way to show you the weight of the merchandise). If the cost is less then you pay the lower amount and if it's more we'll cover the rest (unless you want to pay for faster shipment obviously). If you want a lot of goods and it's going to cost too much for you let us know and we'll find a cost efficient way to deal with it.

For the long-term we're looking at a permanent discount system for all Wikimedia project volunteers.

=== Can I order from outside the US? ===

YES! We want to make sure that people are able to order from anywhere at a reasonable cost. While we don't have a full multi-country distribution system in place yet we've decided to guarantee a maximum shipping price for all orders during our community launch period to make it easier. If the shipping costs are less the $10 USD you will pay that but we'll offer a $10 USD flat rate shipping price for any reasonable size orders above that. We decided to cap orders at 5lbs which would cover 2 sweatshirts with a couple t-shirts and/or other extras (so that very few people will get to that high). If people need bulk orders (for an event or other reasons) they can contact [[User:Jalexander|James Alexander]] at merchandise{{@}}wikimedia.org to try and find a cost efficient way to do it.

=== What about the old CafePress store? ===

The old CafePress store was a good stop gap but doesn't provide us with a great option to expand globally. It had limited options for merchandise (especially quality wise), took a large percentage of the sales and didn't have a lot of traffic (we got $150-$300 in royalties a month from it). We wanted to have more control and be able to produce higher quality products where we could use our leverage to get much better prices. We also wanted to make sure that we could expand this into a global system. That is always difficult to do given that there are very few good examples to follow (we need to be flexible). CafePress doesn't offer any good option to lower prices and/or make the entire process more affordable for international customers and does not allow us to mix up products beyond their partners.

The old CafePress store is still live for now but we're going to shut it down as soon as we can. We've already extracted all of the original designs from it (especially the community contributed ones) and will make sure they are uploaded to Commons if they weren't already. We will be trying to get a hold of everyone who contributed designs to make sure that's okay. Some of the original apparel ideas were awesome. Bacon number? Yes please.

=== What else is coming? This isn't that much. ===

We really want to keep the store both well stocked and fresh with a bunch of new stuff and, eventually, rotating off the old products. Right now we already have a bunch of stuff in preparation and starting to look at the 2nd generation of products to come in. We need your help! Let us know either on the [[Talk:Wikimedia merchandise|talk page]] or on the [[Wikimedia merchandise/Design ideas|Design ideas page]].

Currently in the works:

* Timbuk2 messenger and backpacks (These should 'hopefully' be ready in the next week or two)
* Lapel pins for the Wikimedia logo, MediaWiki and all of the projects.
* Stickers and buttons for Wikimedia, MediaWiki and all of the projects.
* Aluminum Water bottle
* China mugs

We also know that we want to make shirts for the other projects as well. We have some ideas but want the communities. There are a lot of options for the store from what we have now, kids clothes, books etc and a lot of it will depend on what the community and the public wants.

=== Who profits from this shop? ===
One-hundred percent of the proceeds from the Wikimedia shop go to the Wikimedia Foundation and it is not intended to become a [[w:en:Profit center|Profit center]]. The proceeds go back into the shop to keep costs low, subsidize shipping and help provide merch specifically to community members.

=== Is the store secure? ===

Right now the checkout page is fully secure (through Shopify) but we do not have working https throughout the rest of the site (including the login page). This is especially an annoyance for people with HttpsEverywhere installed since it will try to force you to an https connection. That connection (including on the login page) is secure, but will throw a certificate mismatch warning because the certificate and the server identify as myshopify and shopify.com (instead of wikimedia.org). 

We are working with Shopify to make sure that this is fixed as soon as possible and we can provide the most secure and comfortable experience and https throughout the shop. 

For now we're also in touch with the httpsEverywhere team to add an exemption in the *.wikimedia.org rule for shop.wikimedia.org

=== Are there any 3rd parties that you are working with? ===

Yes, given the enormous logistics involved and limited resources we have we're working directly with two main service providers.

Social Imprints is a third-party printing and fulfillment company based here in San Francisco who we've worked with for the past 3-4 years when printing merchandise for the staff, Wikipedia 10 and other events. They are a full service custom printer with a unique social mission, to provide higher paying professional jobs to at risk adults. They help manage the fulfillment and shipping of all orders from the Wikimedia Shop. You can learn more about them at [https://socialimprints.com/ their website].

[[w:en:Shopify|Shopify]] is the online shopping platform that we're using. They provide an easy to use and relatively adaptable platform that services more than 40,000 stores already, including other high traffic stores such as the KONY 2012 campaign and Angry Birds. They have been incredibly excited to work with us and have offered developer resources to adapt the platform to our global needs. You can read more about them at [http://shopify.com their site].

=== Are purchases tax deductible? ===
All of the purchase price of the item goes directly to funding the cost of the merchandise and the shop overhead, therefore we're not able to provide a tax receipt for any of the purchase. 

=== Can I make a donation on the store when I shop? ===
Not yet, but we are looking at that functionality.

=== Where do your products come from? ===
We only source merchandise from socially responsible businesses with ethical manufacturing practices. Our branded products are manufactured in the United States, China, India, Pakistan, El Salvador, and Guatemala, Our fulfillment partner, Social Imprints, is a San Francisco-based employee-owned cooperative that provides professional jobs to at-risk adults in the SF Bay area.

=== Will my order get to me without any issues? ===
We use United States Postal Service and FedEx for deliveries inside the United States and abroad. All of our shipments leave the United States and will likely spend time in the customs for the country where the shipment arrives. We cannot provide any customs clearance estimates, but in most cases shipments may spend anywhere from one to three days in customs.

=== Why don't you accept my currency? ===
Right now we're able to show dozens of global currencies to give you a sense of how our prices convert into other currencies. However, we are only able to actually charge in USD. We're working to implement new payment systems that will allow us to accept not only different currencies, but also dozens of different regional payment systems.

=== How about the store (and products) in my language? ===
This is something (along with more currencies) that is incredibly important to us and shopify has committed to making the software help the store deal with multiple languages. Right now it can be in any language but only 1 at at time :). I'm having a meeting with some guys from their team in the next couple days and will keep everyone up to date on the progress for this. 

=== Why does shipping cost so much? ===
Shipping products internationally is always going to cost more than a domestic shipment. We've created the 'Wikimedia flat-rate global' shipping option, which is $10 USD, to provide a cost-effective way to send a shipment anywhere in the world. In some cases your shipment costs could be well under $10USD, but when it isn't, and when your order is under 5lbs (about 2.2Kg), we provide a subsidized flat rate so customers in all parts of the world can purchase products at a reasonable rate. If you want to order more and cost is a problem let us know and we'll work to find a cost efficient solution.

=== We're Wikipedia - Why can't we have our own designs on the store? ===
Right now we want to make sure we have a minimum collection of high-quality, durable, and high-value products with the Wikipedia and Wikimedia project marks. We're actively looking at services that would allow small-batch printing of user-submitted designs, and soon we will begin to offer limited-edition user-submitted designs posted on Wikimedia Commons and will be taking user ideas for longer term editions as well (see our [[/Design_ideas|Design ideas]] page). Our normal [[wmf:Trademark policy|Trademark policy]] also allows you to make Wikipedia merchandise for yourself (without selling it ) already and we do not plan on changing that.

I was reading through the archives of the Wikipedia-L and saw an excellent suggestion to interlinking that was probably forgotten.  I'm going to update it a bit to make what I think is more feasible.

Basically for every wikipedia article there is a place (seperate from the article) for links to other wikipedias.  I had this idea today when I saw the articles for en:Basic English and eo:Baza Angla and they were both good and had different information.  After adding some content from the en version to the eo version, I realized it would be nice to easily be able to switch versions of wikipedia without typing the entire address over again.

There would be a (neutral language) page that would pop up with the list of languages (displayed in their native language, i.e. espanol, deutsch, etc) and the name of the article associated with them.  At the top of this page there will be a Textbox with a dropdown list of languages next to it.  The user will then select a language from the dropdown list and put the name of the article in that language in the textbox, then they would click a button labelled Link.

At this point the system would see if a language circle (or linked list for you techies) already exists for that article.  If not, then it simply adds it to the new circle.  If there is a circle for that already and there are no conflicts (such as es:Estados Unidos being linked to en:Cat) then it merges the two circles.  If there is a conflict then the system will ask if you want to take es:Estados Unidos out of the translation of en:Cat.  Then the user can choose to cancel or remove es:Estados Unidos from en:Cat.

Pseudocode for this part:

 // Check to see if this article has translations
 if ( language circle exists )
 {
   if ( there is a conflict )
   {
     Ask if user wishes to remove other circle;
     if ( user wishes to remove )
     {
       Clear article name from other language circle;
     }
     else
     {
       Do nothing (Cancel);
     }
   }
   else
   {
     Merge language circles together;
   }
 else
 {
   Add new article to current language circle;
 }

I know it sounds difficult (and probably is), but I think it will be the final solution for the interlinking problem.  I would like it implemented so I can easily jump back and forth among languages for easy comparisons.

Also note that conflicts should be pretty rare so a simplified system could just disallow conflicts to occur (i.e. print an error and say it can't be done when they happen) or automatically clear the entry from the conflicting language circle (probably a better solution).  Also a way to edit an entry in a language circle is necessary (in the case of redirects).

Don't know if this is relevent, but - could we rename this page, please? 'Final international solution' sounds too much like a bad joke. Final solution? We know wikipedians have a sense of history. Don't mean to cause any issues, though. [[User:24.117.213.48|24.117.213.48]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Moved from [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Larry_Sanger]:

Larry, I want to respond to the point you have made on a couple of talk pages that Wikipedia is not a discussion group. I appreciate your point, and I also admit that some of these discussions have gotten a bit excessive and perhaps not very fruitful. But I beg you to reconsider your point, given the particulars. Fundamentally, I do not think all Wikipedia articles are the same. I think some are relatively uncontroversial, while others are very controversial. I also think that with very controversial topics, there is a strong case to be made for replacing neutral point of view for multiple points of view. It would certainly be easier, and it may be more informative. BUT I accept Wikipedia's NPOV policy, as do, I think, all participants in these discussions. My point is that when a diverse group of people are trying to develop an article on a controversial topic while maintaining NPOV it can be very very difficult. In these cases I think the &quot;talk&quot; page is the most convenient place for participants to work though underlying controversial issues, and in fact that is what I think has been going on. Not only do I think it is convenient, I also think it is effective -- and I would ask you to test the value of these very lengthy discussions against the actual evolution of the article. Do you feel that as the discussion progresses, the article moves closer or further away from NPOV? Does it get better or worse?

In short, I do not think that these particular discussions have been self-indulgent or gratuitous; I think they have played an important role in developing carticles on controversial themes. Moreover, such discussions may be unnecessary and inappropriate for less controversial articles. But in this case I think they are necessary and for this reason I ask you to reconsider how you apply this policy, SR
----
I'm sorry, but I'm just not convinced. I'm not the only one who has to be convinced though; there are some others who have agreed with you in the past. My word isn't final on this. But I must say, as well, that your arguments above make me even ''more'' convinced that using [[talk page]]s to sort out debates is a bad idea.

You think it's important to &quot;work through underlying controversial issues.&quot; What does that mean? Does it mean that you have to come to an agreement about them? You'll never do that, at least not on Wikipedia talk pages. Does it mean you need to explain to each other how you understand the material? Well, you can use the article to do that, it seems to me. Why wouldn't you?

You make a good (albeit unoriginal) point, viz., that as the discussion progresses, in many cases, the article becomes more neutral. I think that's grand. But this would be an example of [[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]] (that's where the article should live--not at [[logical fallacy/Post hoc]]), in this case, I think. The article would improve in point of neutrality ''faster'' if you were actually working on the article itself rather than trying to prove who is right and who is wrong. If your opponent says that P, and the article says that not-P, then rather than debating the merits of P, why not simply change the article so that the leading representatives of the view that P are fairly represented in the article? This would save time you'd spend proving the other guy wrong, and generally make a better article to boot. It would also make your lives less stressful, which is always a good thing.

So, I think these discussions over the merits of controversial views ''are'' in very many cases completely self-indulgent and gratuitous. I think the debate over the merits of controversial views (as opposed to debate over how they should be worded, or other stuff having to do with writing the article itself) are mainly a result of our natural desire to make everyone else think the way we do. This is actually rather ironic, because we are all (or most of us) ''allegedly'' committed to the ideal of letting all viewpoints be expressed in articles: if we ''really were'' committed to that ideal, though, why would we have any interest in convincing others that they are wrong and that we are right? --[[LMS]]

:Larry, at the risk of turning this into the kind of abstract discussion you may find gratuitous (because in effect I am trying to change your mind, not concerning your principles but your application of them) I would just like to clarify a few things.

:First, I didn't think my argument was teleological (if I understand post hoc properly), I though I was being pragmatic. (I know enough not to argue just from correlation, I was just trying to point out a distinction that could help measure the effects of something. After all, we can't argue that that if things were different they would be the same, or if things were different they would be worse. All we can go on is observed effects.)

:Second, the reason I do not think that the article would go faster were we working on it, rather than on the talk, is that in my own experience my writing of articles and grant proposals has gone faster after talking about the issues, even in indirect or undisciplined ways, with colleagues; likewise, when collaborating on an article or proposal, often times we could not write more until we hashed out the issues. I realize that other people work differently -- some people hole up and won't talk to anyone while writing. I do not think one method is necessarily better than the other, I think it depends on the people.

:Third, I think you misunderstood how I characterize what is going on. You ask what &quot;working through underlying controversial issues&quot; means and you answer, that it involves &quot;coming to agreement.&quot; I didn't say that and didn't mean that, and although I can see why some people might reach that conclusion it certainly doesn't necessarily follow. In fact, I meant that the discussion can help all participants develop their own understanding of the phenomenon and their own position on it, and can help everyone work towards finding a more effective language for expressing what they want to say. For example, in discussing anti-semitism with RK and Wesley, and finding out what words provoke perhaps unintended critical responses, we can reconsider not the underlying point but the language in which we express it.

:I guess we just fundamentally disagree on what is going on. You seem to see activity on the talk page to be separate from working on the article itself (thus, working on one takes time away from working on the other) -- I see them as part of the same process and not in competition. Most importantly, you interpret people's activity to be motivated by a desire to reach agreement on substantive issues, primarily through what you call &quot;our natural desire to make everyone else think the way we do&quot; (by the way, I suspect it isn't natural; I think humanity's sense of humor and creativity reflect a neuro-psychological bias towards disagreement; this would certainly explain why there is so much cultural variation around the world, and it also would be adaptive). I agree that there are some wikipedians who have this desire and who have expressed it on talk pages. But I simply disagree that this always happens. I do not believe it is true of myself, and there are a number of other people who have been active on these talk pages for whom it is not true, and an unfair characterization. I do think that when you have an open discussion there is a risk that some such people will get involved and slow things down. But I think an the benefits of open discussion are worth the risks, because the payoff -- helping people develop their own understanding of an issue, discovering through a process of engagement what other people want to or need to know, and developing a language that communicates even fundamentally opposing views more effectively, make it worth it, SR

::Hi Larry -- I think it's important to differentiate between the types of discussions, and even the &quot;I'm right, you're wrong&quot; debates that exist. There are more than a few such discussions where people disgree on basic facts and methodology. In those cases, controversial theory rarely comes into question -- unless one editor is approaching things from a totally revisionist viewpoint. Having to debate actual facts (or currently held opinion, rather than something that someone learned 30 years ago and refuses to believe has been disproved) is incredibly frustrating, but it does make the people who care do their homework and find evidence to back &quot;their opinion.&quot; In the long term this makes the article better, providing that research is incorporated. The downside is that, occasionally, a person or persons (and lively discussion does tend to draw more contributors to a subject -- a good thing) will present all kinds of valid evidence and still find that, even though most of those involved come to agreement, the minority will often lie low and do major revisions on the sly, marking them minor edits. So, there's still an edit war, but it comes down to reverting on a semi-regular basis. Alternatively, the person who can't support his thesis eventually gets huffy and goes off and re-creates the same article under several different (related and often misleading) names -- the &quot;I know I'm right,so I'm going to have my say and I know you don't have the time to weed everything&quot; approach. it's frustrating, but what's the alternative? There has to be some kind of mechanism to explain edits, etc., with evidence -- otherwise people get pissed off and leave. [[JHK]]

----
Compromis needed. We must always step back a bit from our own opinons and present the articles with a neutral point of view. This is an encyclopedia we are building, not a collection of essays, talking point, and editorials. We all tend to twist the facts in our favor when we are editorializing -- this has no place in an encylopedia. However, perhaps there should be a Wikipedia IRC channel to accomplish better and faster communication between Wikipedians on any topic of interest (the /Talk pages should be used for discussions that are more relevent to the article). [[Maveric149]] 

:There is a wikipedia IRC channel: #wikipedia on irc.openprojects.net. --AxelBoldt
----
And here I wanted to have a nice lazy Sunday. :-) Below I'm replying to selected points above; my replies are indented. (Would it help if I professed in advance the greatest respect for all involved? I don't want to imply anything personal.)

Second, the reason I do not think that the article would go faster were we working on it, rather than on the talk, is that in my own experience my writing of articles and grant proposals has gone faster after talking about the issues, even in indirect or undisciplined ways, with colleagues; likewise, when collaborating on an article or proposal, often times we could not write more until we hashed out the issues.

:Do you ''really'' think it's ''true'' that the article would develop more slowly if you were to spend as much time on it as on the talk page? That seems to be what you're saying. But isn't it nearly self-evidently false to say that?

:Anyway, your experience in academia with colleagues is not neatly applicable here, since we aren't doing original research here. We're reporting about research that has already been done. The sorts of discussion that one engages in, when one does original research, in many cases does not need to engaged in here, in order to write a good article.

I realize that other people work differently -- some people hole up and won't talk to anyone while writing. I do not think one method is necessarily better than the other, I think it depends on the people.

:Well, I think endless back-and-forth on issues that are tangential at best to improving the article is clearly to be avoided, no matter who you are. I do not deny that it can, sometimes, result in improvements to an article; what I deny is that it is more ''efficient'' (for ''anybody'') than working on the article itself.

Third, I think you misunderstood how I characterize what is going on. You ask what &quot;working through underlying controversial issues&quot; means and you answer, that it involves &quot;coming to agreement.&quot; 

:Well, in fairness, I asked you what you meant (because it wasn't clear to me), and &quot;coming to agreement&quot; was only one suggestion.

In fact, I meant that the discussion can help all participants develop their own understanding of the phenomenon and their own position on it, and can help everyone work towards finding a more effective language for expressing what they want to say.

:Why are we trying to decide what ''we'' want to say at all? Frankly, I don't care what you want to say. :-) I don't care what I want to say either, or what JHK (no offense Julie) wants to say, etc.--except to the extent that what we all want to say reflects any of the leading (or even &quot;significant minority&quot;) approaches to the material. For examples of that, we need go no farther, in many cases, than introductory texts and other basic expositions of the material we are writing about. Why don't we then model ourselves on the best of those ordinary sorts of formulations? That is how I have tried to edit my philosophy articles--i.e., I don't try to write what I &quot;want to say&quot; about any given topic. Instead, I try to represent what the state of the debate is on the topic. I might not always do a great job, but that's what I'm trying to do, at least.

::I guess I didn't express myself well -- for me, the operative word in my sentence was not &quot;we&quot; (raising the issue of subjectivity) but rather &quot;say.&quot;

:::OK, let me try to understand. You said that talk page debates are useful for deciding what we want to say. There are two interpretations of this: (1) the debates are useful for determining how we want to think about the subject matter; (2) the debates are useful for determining what we want to say in the article. I fully admit that (2) states a legitimate use of talk pages; but those aren't the debates I'm complaining about. When the discussion strays for many paragraphs and many iterations onto the subject itself, when, Usenet-style, you're ''just'' trying to show off how much you know about the subject and prove that the other guy is wrong, you're abusing the Wikipedia system, I think. That's not what it's for. ''And,'' not a few people are still doing this. It's what's happening on [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/White_supremacy/Talk this page], for example.

:: also, although I see your point about the difference between original research and discussions of previous research, I do not think that in terms of the issues raised here the difference is that great. Facts simply do not speak for themselves. When I write an article about some social phenomenon, based on my own research, I am writing about something that most people in the society in question take for granted and do not think is very complicated, and yet I spend a lot of time thinking about it and try in my analysis to complicate things. Well, in &quot;literature reviews&quot; we need to observe another kind of social behavior (academic or political discourse) and report on it. In some cases, as you suggest, this is really straightforward. In some cases, how exactly to classify and describe different positions may itself be controversial. This doesn't mean that writing an accurate neutral description of the discourse is impossible -- but it may take a bit more work, that benefits from some discussion with others.

:::You're continuing to point out excellent uses of talk pages that ''are not'' of the sort that I'm complaining about. Yes, I can imagine that someone might want to confer with colleagues about the details of how to present some research results on a [[talk page]]. There couldn't be anything more appropriate. But that ''isn't'' what is going on, on any reasonable construal, in very many talk page discussions. The point, just to beat it to death, is that a lot of people just ''looove'' to prove other people wrong and to prove themselves right, and it's pretty obvious to any veteran of Usenet and mailing list warfare that that is what is going on, yet again, all too often on Wikipedia. It won't do to point to the many legitimate uses of talk pages that ''bear a passing resemblance'' to &quot;I'm right-you're wrong&quot; discussions; I'll admit that there are many such legitimate uses. But that doesn't refute, or even reduce the force of, my complaint!

For example, in discussing anti-semitism with RK and Wesley, and finding out what words provoke perhaps unintended critical responses, we can reconsider not the underlying point but the language in which we express it.

:Well, it seems that here you're coming closer to my point: one perfectly legitimate purpose of talk pages, as I see it, is indeed to &quot;reconsider not the underlying point but the language in which we express it.&quot; I'd agree with that. It seems, though, that we are considering and reconsidering &quot;the underlying points&quot; rather too much.

I guess we just fundamentally disagree on what is going on.

:Maybe, but bear in mind we can't have a genuine disagreement if we don't fully understand each other's viewpoints, which is why we're talking.

::This is precisely why I think there is more value to what has been going on in the talk pages. I would only qualify this by saying that sometimes the disagrement is not over &quot;the truth&quot; of a topic, but rather over state of the popular or scholarly discourse on the topic, and over the language best suited to describing that. I now think we agree that talk can sometimes be constructive or sometimes be unconstructive. We disagree either in our criteria for recognizing constructive/unconstructive talk, or how we apply those criteria to actual discussions in Wikipedia.

:::I said: &quot;we can't have a genuine disagreement if we don't fully understand each other's viewpoints, which is why we're talking.&quot; You replied: &quot;This is precisely why I think there is more value to what has been going on in the talk pages.&quot; I find that very interesting. I maintain, and you have not yet explicitly denied, that the ''sole'' value of talk pages is in ''improving encyclopedia articles.'' Now, to improve encyclopedia articles, it often ''isn't important'' whether we understand why we have a disagreement. So I emphatically ''deny'' that talk pages are well used when they are used ''just'' to discover why we have a disagreement on the subject matter.

:::Now, there are senses in which endless blather, trying to prove each other wrong, is perfectly constructive. But constructive ''for what''? Perhaps for the education and edification of the participants; but ''often not,'' I maintain, for the benefit of Wikipedia articles.

You seem to see activity on the talk page to be separate from working on the article itself (thus, working on one takes time away from working on the other) -- I see them as part of the same process and not in competition. 

:No, I don't disagree with you on that. This has been common knowledge, in fact, nearly from the beginning. (It's why I invented the convention of a talk page in the first place!) ''Properly'' used, talk page discussions are important components in the development of articles.

:My point is more specific: ''trying to debate the merits of controversial views,'' in particular, is in many if not all cases a ''comparative waste of time.'' We do this far too much--trying to determine who's right and who's wrong--when we could be writing articles. We should remember that it is inappropriate to play the part of partisans, here, because we are collaborators, and it is difficult at best for interested partisans to be good collaborators. Arguably, collaborators have obligations to each other to do what's necessary to work together. With this in mind, I actually think we should all go ''out of our way'' to make sure the enemy's views are fairly represented.

:Hence, I find this back-and-forth, of trying not only to make an article say something controversial, but then actually ''defending'' that, is petty and silly, not to mention (given our goals) simply irrational. It really needs to stop. Would you disagree with that?

:: yes, I agree.

Most importantly, you interpret people's activity to be motivated by a desire to reach agreement on substantive issues,

:Actually, I would deny that this is most important; it's usually best not to try to read people's minds or ascribe nasty motivations to them, and I shouldn't have done that in the first place. Whether or not they do have the desire to reach agreement (or, as I said, to make others agree with them), the fact of the matter is that they do all too often engage in what I think is petty and unnecessary debate over substantial issues, with the evident purpose of justifying their action (or proposed action) of making a Wikipedia article take what is in fact a controversial stand.

I do think that when you have an open discussion there is a risk that some such people will get involved and slow things down. But I think an the benefits of open discussion are worth the risks, because the payoff -- helping people develop their own understanding of an issue, discovering through a process of engagement what other people want to or need to know, and developing a language that communicates even fundamentally opposing views more effectively, make it worth it, SR

:Again, I don't deny there are payoffs; I just think they are quite a bit smaller than the payoffs of focusing on the articles and going out of our way to work together on them. It might be ''more efficient'' in the end, and therefore ''better'' for the article and ''better'' for the whole project, if you avoided engaging in substantive debate over issues with the aim of defending controversial edits.

:It's not as though you sat down and said to yourself: &quot;Hmm, what's the best way to improve these articles? Why not engage in endless, unresolvable, partisan dialogue about the subject matter that these articles concern? Sure, that would be just the thing!&quot; Nope, I imagine the ordinary case is like this: you came across Wikipedia one day, thought it was pretty neat, you joined in, you wrote something that someone found outrageously biased, or someone wrote something that you found outrageously biased. You then got into a debate about the issue itself. Then I happened along and said, &quot;Hey, this debate is pointless. Why not commit yourself to the neutral point of view, try to help your enemy represent his view fairly, and work on the article itself?&quot;

:: well, I can only speak for my own case, which was this: I discovered Wikipedia, saw articles I thought were misleading or incomplete, and made changes that I thought had NPOV and were improvements. In one case (the Nietzsche articel) someone just deleted what I added; I put it back in and it was deleted again. This led me to indeed waste about an hour justifying what to me was an obvious improvement by writing a lengthy &quot;talk&quot; contribution. In most cases whatever I wrote prompted someone else to ask me why I thought it was an improvement or NPOV. In these cases I responded in the talk section, and in some cases these discussions developed. I do not think that I was trying to convince my interlocutor that I was right, nor do I think he or she was trying to convince me that I was wrong. But there are some issues in which readers are not satisfied that &quot;Some say&quot; is adequate to provide NPOV, or if it is adequate to provide NPOV, it is inadequate to a fully informative article. Much of the talk was subjective, I admit -- thank god for Talk pages, because such subjectivity has no place in the article itself. But I nevertheless feel that such subjective talk eventually led to language that people from diverse views could agree on as accurate and neutral.

:: this leads me to be able to articulate one of the things I like, and find significant, about Wikipedia. It is a point that you might find unoriginal, but I haven't really seen it made in any accounts of Wikipedia I have read, and I think it give more explanation of my view in this matter. What first drew me to Wikipedia was that it was an open, collaborative effort, that many writers were working together. Now I realize that crucial to this process is that the writers are also readers, and that the project by its nature puts reader-response theory into practice. Talk pages are not simply places where collaborators discuss how to write an article, they are simultaneously places where readers express their own readings/interpretations of what has been written -- which provide crucial feedback for someone who has tried to write a neutral and uncontroversial account of something and wonders whether readers will find it to be neutral and uncontroversial.

:::I actually think that the people who do not adequately understand, or who inadequately respect, the neutrality policy are precisely the ones who engage in endless talk page discussions about the subject matter itself. There are exceptions, but that seems to be the rule. If those people could commit themselves to learning how to write in an unbiased fashion, they would both reduce the felt impulse (by themselves and others) to challenge and justify edits on the basis of neutrality, ''and'' they would better understand how to use talk pages to come to a consensus.

:::I do not like the idea of justifying the Usenet-type behavior on grounds that it allows people to arrive, eventually, at a consensus. In my experience, people who constantly engage in Usenet-type behavior often ''can't'' arrive at a consensus, and it's often because some more reasonable person comes along and shuts them up by actually resolving the issue that they could have resolved themselves! The last thing that the Usenet candidates need to be told is that their blathering on and on helps them to arrive at a consensus: if they ''really'' were interested in arriving at a consensus, they could have done it long ago!

:::Look, I'm not saying we all have to be perfect, or anything. I'm not saying we should be strictly business, always. But I ''am'' saying that, right now, and in the past several months, there have been a number of people who are basically using Wikipedia as their chat area, and I think that's an abuse of the project. And I think it should stop. --[[LMS]]

Now JHK's comment:

Hi Larry -- I think it's important to differentiate between the types of discussions, and even the &quot;I'm right, you're wrong&quot; debates that exist.

:Yes, maybe that should be made clearer. I had just hoped it was clear that I was talking about only one category of discussion that takes place.

There are more than a few such discussions where people disgree on basic facts and methodology. In those cases, controversial theory rarely comes into question -- unless one editor is approaching things from a totally revisionist viewpoint.

:Actually, I think that even such debates are grounded in different, often political or philosophical, viewpoints, although those particular viewpoints aren't the ones under discussion. For example, Helga has seemed at times to want a lot of articles written that express particular sympathy for Prussians in Poland, and this has occasionally led to inaccurate or misleading texts, or in any event biased texts. In that sort of case, if we really want to work together, I think it will help a lot to acknowledge our individual biases and then do our best to accommodate each other's biases (as well as those of others who, by pure accident, happen not to be part of Wikipedia yet).

:Now, what to do when ''you'' want to be as unbiased as all get-out but the other guy merely pays lip service, or doesn't understand, or actively opposes the nonbias policy? You make the issue explicitly one about the nonbias policy. If it turns out that someone is totally opposed to it, I'll just ask the person to leave. (There was a recent scene in which I did just that, and frankly I don't regret it one bit.) If they don't want to play by the rules, they can leave the playground.

Having to debate actual facts (or currently held opinion, rather than something that someone learned 30 years ago and refuses to believe has been disproved) is incredibly frustrating, but it does make the people who care do their homework and find evidence to back &quot;their opinion.&quot; In the long term this makes the article better, providing that research is incorporated.

:I think you were dealing with a special case here...I should have tried to intervene sooner, I think. In your case, though, the long discussions did at least keep the articles looking relatively good.

:I'm thinking about the case in the [[abortion]] article when there were people slugging it out in the usual way people slug that issue out, and just about all I had to do was extensively rewrite the article. This took less time than replying to one person would have, and it was at least quite a bit less biased than it had been. Then people shut up. Would the article have been better if I had not edited and the partisans continued to slug it out? I seriously doubt it.

:Isn't it bizarre that discussion of an article (or of an article's subject) very often becomes several times longer than the article itself? Oh, sure, that's necessary in some cases--but only some!

The downside is that, occasionally, a person or persons (and lively discussion does tend to draw more contributors to a subject -- a good thing) 

:Is it? Maybe they'd be working on other subjects that also need attention. We've got big long articles about abortion, God, anti-Semitism, etc., all the &quot;sexy&quot; topics, and squat about Goethe.

will present all kinds of valid evidence and still find that, even though most of those involved come to agreement, the minority will often lie low and do major revisions on the sly, marking them minor edits. So, there's still an edit war, but it comes down to reverting on a semi-regular basis.

:Yes. Perhaps we should call those people to task more often. Are ya wi' us or agin' us? Are we doing this together or not?

Alternatively, the person who can't support his thesis eventually gets huffy and goes off and re-creates the same article under several different (related and often misleading) names -- the &quot;I know I'm right,so I'm going to have my say and I know you don't have the time to weed everything&quot; approach. it's frustrating, but what's the alternative? There has to be some kind of mechanism to explain edits, etc., with evidence -- otherwise people get pissed off and leave. [[JHK]]

:Well, as I said, if anybody leaves, it should be the people who aren't playing by the rules. --[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
First: &lt;BR&gt;thanks to all of you for this highly interesting discussion in wich you all show clear character

Secondly my own personal rave:
&lt;BR&gt;to me Wikipedia isn't a fixed product, but a perpetual process. The facts itself are pretty boring; why it is 'fact' is more interesting - most will change in time anyway. To me the /Talk-pages are an essential enrichment of the encyclopedic articles of 'fact'. They present the sources of 'fact'. They are the most fun to read. They inspire me more than anything else. Larry, in the light of your purpose of creating an encyclopia of fact I understand you'd like to keep all committed and focussed on this, but I believe you'll never be able to weed it out. It's human to argument. It's fun to exchange viewpoints. Just see it as a glossaria. The fact is just a snapshot of consensus. To me there is no true NPOV possible. All things have their root. To me it's important to see this to truely understand your subjects. (I'm looking for words, but I hope you do get my drift) The /Talk-pages are why I am a wikipediholic. --Mathijs (nice to meet people - no need to agree)
----
I could see attaching discussion forums to each page: each page has not only a /Talk page for discussing the article, but also a forum page for discussing the subject matter. If that would attract more people to the project ''without detracting from our purpose'' (creating an encyclopedia), I'd be all for it. I just don't know if it would detract from our purpose. An encyclopedia is '''way'' more important than the umpteenth iteration of silly arguments about thus-and-such. --LMS

''to you it may be silly, but to the writer (and in his opinion some readers) of the argument it is valuable enough.'' --Mathijs 

:The writer of the argument might be wrong; the fact that someone finds it valuable doesn't make it so. Not to get into an argument about metaethics, it should suffice to say that in the opinion of very many Wikipedians who are at work on ''articles,'' talk page arguments ''are'' all too often silly and pointless for this project. --LMS

Mathijs, you should know by now that claims to the effect that neutrality is impossible will be interpreted (by me :-) ) as declarations to the effect that you do not understand the Wikipedia neutrality policy. So, please read [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.fcgi?action=browse&amp;amp;id=Neutral_point_of_view the recently expanded neutrality policy page]. I don't know if &quot;neutrality&quot; in the sense described there is what you regard as &quot;true NPOV,&quot; but neutrality in the sense described there is, in any case, what we are aiming at. It's one point that defines this project, and has from the beginning. --[[LMS]]

''NPOV may be 'neutral', but it's still a '''point of view'''. Still, NPOV is good policy; what I try to state is that the discussion, behind and around the articles, is '''complementary''' to the NPOV-encyclopedia of 'fact'. The 'Palestine'- and corresponding 'Palestine/Talk'-articles are a good example of this: in the 'Palestine'-article you may get good, objective information about Palestine, &amp;amp; it is getting better every day, but in the 'Palestine/Talk' you will read things which will benefit your insight and which gives complementary information about the subject. NPOV ain't a static truth, but something that is made by people. One single point of view gives you a two-dimensional picture of the 'fact'. Every point-of-view that is added, adds a dimension of 'fact', gives 'body' to the 'fact'. Also, readers might be aware that every article is written by people, with their own particular knowledge, insight, beliefs and opinions.'' --Mathijs 

I agree with the above. I value Wikipedia mainly as a source of new, exciting ideas (well, new and exciting for me, anyways). The talk pages offer many different views of whatever issue is under consideration. Someone (like me) who is mainly interested in the &quot;bold&quot;, edgy aspects of Wikipedia is going to spend more time reading (and perhaps contributing to) talk pages - they are always bolder than the corresponding article. And I do believe serious intellectual effort is expended into their creation. In general, I personally find articles too cautious to be very useful. Plus, because they can do little more than juxtapose differing viewpoints, they often lack the structural unity that I like in written text. --[[Seb]]
----
LMS replying to italicized Mathijs comments above: there are a couple of different things you could mean by saying that the neutral point of view is, after all, ''a point of view.'' I do not know which one of these, or some other, you mean by that declaration. I'll dwell on this a bit because I think it's very important (I try not to miss opportunities to clarify the policy).

First, you could mean that one ''does'' make definite declarations about this and that when writing neutral text. This is true, but if the text is neutral, then by definition, its declarations are not declarations ''on topics that virtually anyone finds controversial.'' Neutral text does not express opinions; it describes them, without asserting them. Second, you could mean that, in writing neutral text, we evince a certain point of view according to which objectivity is possible and desirable. This is wrong in two different ways. (a) One needn't ''agree'', when writing from the neutral point of view, that such writing is a good thing. One might hate it bitterly, but do it anyway. You couldn't say that such a person believes objectivity is possible, necessarily; such a person might think it's totally impossible, but he fakes it anyway. Moreover, (b) even if we necessarily had to agree that neutral writing is possible and desirable when writing neutral text, it is important to note that neutrality (in the sense defined on [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Neutral_point_of_view the NPOV page]) is not the same as objectivity. The NPOV page goes into some detail about this. On most accounts of objectivity, there might be an objectively true view about some controversial issue; in that case, to state that controversial view would be to exemplify objectivity. Well, that's not what neutrality is.

You also say: &quot;the discussion, behind and around the articles, is '''complementary''' to the NPOV-encyclopedia of 'fact'.&quot; This again could mean various things. I would agree completely with you if you meant by this that the talk page discussions ''ought to'' to help the development of encyclopedia articles. That's what I think. But if you mean, as I suspect you do mean, that the talk pages an integral part of the overall &quot;Wikipedia experience,&quot; and that our purpose in working on Wikipedia is to enhance that experience--both the writing of articles and blathering on about the subjects of the articles--then I completely disagree. The purpose of Wikipedia is '''to write an encyclopedia.''' It is ''not'' any part of our purpose to provide a discussion forum; the only reason why we have a discussion forum is to improve articles. Now, you might have observed that talk pages might have various other benefits that you enjoy; but the facts that you enjoy them and that WikiWiki software can be used to provide for such enjoyment in no way supports the view that it is any part of the purpose of Wikipedia to provide a discussion forum. I could, for example, write a nice long poem about Emily Dickenson and put it on the Dickenson talk page, and then declare: &quot;Poetry is complementary to Wikipedia.&quot; Sure, it ''could be made to be,'' because that's how WikiWikis are. But it has long been decreed by yours truly that we are here first and foremost to write an encyclopedia, and that's beyond debate! --[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Seb: I hate to be blunt, but I think you should reconsider why you're here. If you're ''really'' here mainly for the talk page discussions, I think that's a serious problem. Why not just go to Usenet? Why bother us here on Wikipedia with it? --[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
So, Larry, have you made a decision on the possible establishment of /Debate or /Forum pages, as suggested above? My own experience may help color your decision. In preparing to write an article on the philosophical implications of the halting problem, I scoured the web to see what discussion (informed and otherwise) was out there in cyber land. I actually came away feeling that the pages of Wikipedia provided some of my best insights into the emotional debate and confusion surrounding this arcane topic.

As long as the Wikipedian community approach the collective task of building an encyclopedia with understanding, politeness and good will, I can see no harm in /Debate pages. It might actually help to keep the serious writers more focused by moving the biased discussion off the /Talk pages onto /Debate pages. On the other hand, this might just muddle things more. --srwenner
----
I think we should have a separate discussion (not on this page) on the proposal, specifically, of hosting discussion pages associated with Wikipedia articles. I really don't know what to think about it. On the one hand, it would be attractive to many people. On the other hand, I worry very much that it would siphon off a lot of productive energy from the project itself.

If we did do it, I think we should have specially-written software for it, integrated with the rest of the software. --[[LMS]]
----
I don't see a difference. I hate the debate on talk pages (no really), but find myself regularly compelled to justify what I see as legitimate changes to articles. The best way to do this would be to use a source within the article, but frankly, there are a hell of a lot of folks who don't know a good source from a bad one. Since training and expertise seem to mean little when it comes to the field of History (and why is it that people who would never feel comfortable questioning a trained philosopher, mathemetician, name your field think that they understand history better than trained historians, anyway?), there needs to be some place to at least try to demonstrate why and how edits are made. It's not a good situation, but I'd rather err on the side of more info than less. [[JHK]]
----
Well, the talk page discussion that you're talking about is focused on justifying edits. I think that's OK. The talk page discussion that I think is not OK is debate for its own sake, or to try to persuade someone else that he's wrong and you're right. I think there's a definite tendency on the part of strong partisans to engage in that kind of debate, and I think that dilutes the purpose of the 'pedia ''project.'' The reason this project has ''worked'' as well as it has is that it has been really focused on ''creating an encyclopedia.''

Now, if there were a supplementary website, that had a very clearly-stated, separate purpose (discussion of the subject matter of articles), then--well, why not? Then my main objection to Wikipedia's hosting of discussion-for-its-own-sake is dissolved.

My position on this is similar to my position in creating Meta-Wikipedia. All the discussion about the process was diverting attention from the thing itself, from the task at hand. So I suggested we move it, and by golly, I'm very glad we did. --[[User:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----

Just thought I'd cast my vote (or whatever it might translate to in this context). I personally hardly ever read the talk pages, I'm just here for the information, thus I'm a bit naive as to the goings-on that this discussion is about. Although, I do understand the nature of the discussion and I personally feel that the ''purpose'' of the 'pedia is the documentation of ''humanity'' and it's collective knowledge and understanding (I don't want to start a debate on the purpose). To further abuse the abortion example I'd like to state that when (if I were to) read an article about, say &quot;Abortion (Morality)&quot; as a random example, I would want to understand the different POV's and gather an appreciation of the passion and depth of the debate as a document (&quot;Cliffs Notes: The Abortion Debate&quot;) outlining the various points and key issues. This is definatly the place in which the &quot;talk-page-nonsense&quot; is no longer nonsense, being as it is entirely relevant to documenting such an exchange. On the other hand, I most definatly '''''don't''''' want to see links to &quot;Donate to Moms Against Murdered Babies&quot; or other such displays of blind disregard for the other participants in the discussion.

In other words, I think that so long as the discussion is about the ''representation'' of the documentation and not an attempt to ''solve'' the issue that they are documenting then it is entirely relevant. Thus, if there is a &quot;solution&quot; to the issue then the page should outline this, and be done with it, otherwise, if the topic is still an open matter, then simply state that it is, and present the possibilities or alternative ideas ''seperately''. There is no need to try and decide &quot;which opinion ''(which might be called fact by proponents)'' to display&quot;, simply display them both/all, insofar as the ''facts'' are correctly backed, etc. Only when there is an issue concerning the ''presentation'' of this documentation should there be activity on the talk pages. There are plenty of other places on the net to ''discuss'' the implications of abortion (to take the previous example) besides here... and once (if) the conclusion has been reached ''outside'' of Wikipedia, then document it ''in'' the Wikipedia.

'''Example:'''

''Assume hypothetically that my comment (above) is a Wikipedia article and the following is discussion on the related talk page, ''

: Your abortion analogy is completely grotesque and morbid&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, especially the name of the example organization posting a request for donations&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;!
: Couldn't you have said &quot;People for the Ethical Treatment of Unborn ''People''&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;? After all, they ''are'' people&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;! --[[Discusted Reader]]

:: I'd be happy to change the name of the group, How about &quot;Some random organization&quot; just nice and generic? --[[Compassionate Writer]]

#Opinion, thus irrelevant to the topic at hand. I don't mean to sound insensitive to the readers feelings, but I am also not about to &quot;feel sorry&quot; for her (at least not as a motivation to alter the ''nature'' of the article)
#Ok, some meat. She disagrees with the representation. Point taken, I'll change it.
#An example, or further explanation. Good stuff, although this is a bit sided!
#Blatant trolling. I'll ignore it. Or maybe mention something about &quot;I'm not here to discuss that issue here, but if you think that perspective should be represented then edit the appropriate article. ''Blah blah blah... (whatever, etc, etc)''&quot;

I've done my best to present the disctinction as clearly as I can, let me know if there are any confusions. Although, personally I'm not interested in your disagreement, so please don't reply to tell me that I'm wrong in thinking so, I'm just here to document my opinion, to stand up and be counted ya know? (How does one punnctuate the ''&quot;ya know?&quot;'' idiom anyways? :P )

Anyways, thanks for reading!

== Wiki-Debate ==
For what it's worth, I set up a [http://forum.for-pgh.org Wiki-debate] website, and you are welcome to use it to debate whatever topic you like. I get irritated when articles turn into debates, and debating on the talk page is next to useless since there is no structure to the debate. I think that a wiki could provide good structure for a debate, so I played around with the idea. You can see what I came up with at http://forum.for-pgh.org and play around with it if you like.

I think there's a place online that will make limited numbers of t-shirts for a very reasonable price, without committing anyone to any particular number.  Does anyone want to look into this?  This is a great idea, but I just won't have much time to work on it, as worthy a cause it might be.  (It ''is'' a worthy cause--I've spent a lot of time organizing Nupedia t-shirts and I know it's a bit of work!) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

:[http://www.cafepress.com/ Cafe Press]?  It's used by a few of the online comics I read for T-shirts, coffee mugs and mousepads, with no minimum quantity. --[[user:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]]

Exactly the one!  Very cool!  Now all we need is a big image to put on the t-shirt.  It won't take long to sign up with them and it looks like they do all the work.  It's just that the t-shirts are going to cost some absurd amount of money like $13 or $14.

I might have to get some Wikipedia briefs.  :-) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

If no one is willing to take up this idea, I would be willing to do it, does anyone else want to set this up or should I just take charge?  It would be nice to have this set up before [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Wikipedia_Day Wikipedia Day].  --[[Chuck Smith]]

Thanks, Lee!  I was wondering who was going to do that.  I'll have to look into what sort of format they need.  If you want to investigate yourself, that would be a tremendous help.  (These days, I need all the help I can get.  I'm incredibly busy...) --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

Dreamyshade, I know Scott Redd of the Esperanto wikipedia said he'd design them, perhaps I should pester him some more...  He's planning to create an English and an Esperanto version!  :)  Perhaps I'll buy them both.  ;)  --[[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]]

Are the shirts still going to be made?  [[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]

I just recently ran across this page and like the idea. I also just recently got some iron-on T-shirt transfers and made myself a Wikipedia T-shirt. See the design at [[w:User:Wapcaplet|my Wikipedia user page]]. I'd be willing to whip up something similcar once a design is decided upon. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 02:20 23 Jun 2003 (UTC)

== Norwegian comic strip (2006) ==
The Norwegian [http://www.start.no/tegneserier/m/?1161900000 comic strip &quot;M&quot; for October 27, 2006] ([[:en:M (comic strip)|M]] by [[:en:Mads Eriksen|Mads Eriksen]]) featured a Wikipedia T-shirt of an alternative design with just one &quot;W&quot; puzzle piece. The text reads: ''Wait, wait / Dear! Come here for a moment! / Okay, repeat again what you just said. / eh, well, so this exclusive encyclopedia can be yours... /  ''(in phone)'' Knut, Knut, listen to this... / Bwahaha... Who do you think we are? The Flintstones?'' --[[User:LA2|LA2]] 15:55, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Ideas for T-shirt Design ===

Let's list some ideas and then in traditional manner &quot;vote&quot; on them...

#Offer shirts which have a date and significant events in history, that occurred on that date.
#The front has the wikipedia logo on it.  The back is blank. (lacks the URL - AxelBoldt)
#Front: big wikipedia logo.
#On the front: text &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, white on a black background. Back: Wikipedia logo with &quot;The free encyclopedia&quot; written underneath.
#Has the Nike &quot;Swoosh&quot; image with the tag: Just Wikipedia It. Back: big letters saying &quot;wikipedia.com&quot;. (lacks the information that users can edit - AxelBoldt)
#Front: logo.  Back: &quot;Be bold in updating pages!&quot;  Then a carriage return and then &quot;wikipedia.com&quot;. (primary votes: 7: [[user:WojPob|WojPob]], [[w:Dreamyshade]], LMS, [[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]], AxelBoldt, Seb, [[user:sjc|sjc]]) (secondary votes: 1: [[user:Rose Parks|Rose Parks]]) '''7.5 votes'''
#Front: logo.  Back: &quot;20,000 articles created in one year.&quot; Next line: &quot;www.wikipedia.com&quot;  (blue underlined)You can edit this T-shirt right now! (/blue underlined)&quot;. (appears a bit wordy - AxelBoldt) (needs editing, how about &quot;From the Aa River to ZX Spectrum in one year&quot; - AriPap) (secondary votes: 5: [[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]], [[user:Stefano Kalb|Stefano Kalb]], [[user:WojPob|WojPob]], [[w:Dreamyshade]], LMS)) '''2.5 votes'''
#Same as #4 above but with re-attachable coloured felt-tip pen. (Cafe Press probably can't do this)
#Front: logo.  Back: &quot;Edit this page&quot; translated into 22 languages. (would sell best to the non-English wikipedias and show off the international aspect of the project) (primary votes: 8: [[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]], [[user:Stefano Kalb|Stefano Kalb]], [[user:Rose Parks|Rose Parks]], [http://www.shoesnike.cn Buzz], [[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]], [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], [[user:Koyaanis Qatsi|KQ]], [[User:Cohesion|Cohesion]]) (secondary votes: 1: AxelBoldt) (tertiary votes: 1: LMS) '''9.8 votes'''
#Front: A huge 'W' in the Wikipedia logo font. Back: the Wikipedia logo and URL
#Front: &quot;Be bold in updating pages!&quot; carriage return Wikipedia logo then &quot;wikipedia.com&quot;. Back: &quot;Edit text of this page&quot; translated into [[22 languages]]
#Front: &quot;Be bold in updating pages!&quot; with &quot;www.wikpedia.org&quot; (not .com) and logo. Back: &quot;Edit this page&quot; (not &quot;Edit text of this page&quot; or &quot;Edit the text of this page&quot;) translated into 22 languages (only 2 so far).
#International: Front: &quot;www.wikpedia.org&quot; (not .com) no logo (which is English), with &quot;Edit this page&quot; (not &quot;Edit text of this page&quot; or &quot;Edit the text of this page&quot;) translated into 22 languages (only 2 so far) below. Back: &quot;Be bold in updating pages!&quot; translated into 22 languages (only 2 so far). (primary votes: 1: [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3AI_am_Jack%27s_username I am Jack's username]) '''1 vote'''
#Random articles printed all over every which way.
#Back: &quot;Edit&quot;/&quot;Edit this text&quot; in the lower right corner?
#What about a foundation t-shirt?  Black or white with colour foundation logo.  I like the multiple language ideas, maybe with &quot;Edit this shirt&quot; or something similar?
#A black tee shirt. On the front, over the breast: &quot;Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia&quot; (the logo's text, without the puzzlepiece Death-Star-egg). On the back, in large print: &quot;Wikipedia Researcher&quot; and the Wikipedia web address. My aim is to have a more professional-looking shirt which identifies me as someone who's actively researching articles. - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Brian_Kendig Brian Kendig]
#Simply: WIKI in big, bold letters on the front, with -pedia, -media -book -quote -news, etc.
#Front: All of the Wikimedia logos not just Wikipedia (Wikibooks, Wikispecies, etc...).
#Front: Big &quot;W&quot;, like in the Norwegian comic strip. Back: &quot;Free knowledge for a free world.&quot; --[[User:Schaelle|Schaelle]] 21:04, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
#Front: &quot;Citation Needed&quot; in bold with the wikipedia logo on the breast. On the back: &quot;Wikipedia - the free encyclopedia&quot; - L33T-pwnerer.
#Black t-shirt with white text and white t-shirt with black text that says &quot;I edit Wikipedia.&quot; in some regular font.
#Front: &quot;disambiguate&quot; in large font, with &quot;Wikipedia&quot; underneath in small font.
I can get the texts for the 22 languages by asking at soc.culture.esperanto...  now we just need someone willing to design the T-shirt... 
#Rory Campbell:Hey you guys, I've been using your site sooo long now just finding information about different bands and then reporting back to my friends about them. I want 10 of your shirts please!
*Idiot. I suggest having the text, ''I'm with genius'' on the front of a shirt, with an arrow between the text and the top of the shirt pointing towards the head. Have the WP logo on the front of a cap, with the URL on the back of the cap. [[User:Hunterd|Hunterd]] 09:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
# I would like a shirt that just says Iheart wikipedia, like the NY shirts.

If we could actually get some real images up here, that would help. Do people in non-English wikipedias know about the T-shirt design vote?

=== Image requirements ===

This is from the [http://www.cafepress.com CafePress] [http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/images.aspx help desk]:

* Image size: at least 200x200 pixels
* Image formats supported: [[w:BMP|BMP]], [[w:JPEG|JPEG]], [[w:GIF|GIF]]
* Resolution: 150 to 300 DPI

Should we set a deadline for votes and put a link on the front page of the wikipedias?

Make sure its a fair trade t shirt! [[User:78.144.58.60|78.144.58.60]] 15:35, 13 September 2007 (UTC)


I, for one, find that CafePress products are shoddy quality. Can't Wikipedia get a real T-shirt maker to make some shirts? [[User:Andrevan|Andrevan]] 20:13, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)


Hi, it will be advertising since I'm a spreadshirt representative, but you might wish to try the &quot;flock&quot; printing method at your spreadshirt shop.
To do so the print can be only up to three colors, but you can print also on dark shirts and the print is durable (no fading at all).

Also, since the end of last year spreadshirt is selling not only in German but in 8 European languages.
For the US we have our own warehouse, so shipping of US orders takes place from within the US - this gives quick delivery times and low shipping costs.

Check out http://www.spreadshirt.net/ for EU, [http://www.omnibet.ro/clasamente-fotbal/ clasamente fotbal], and http://www.spreadshirt.com/ for the US.

==Disparity between displayed back-of-shirt and real back-of-shirt==
In early March 2005, I ordered a Wikipedia white t-shirt [http://www.cafepress.com/wikipedia.18995781]. Upon receipt, I was somewhat disappointed that the back said &quot;Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org)&quot; rather than &quot;Edit this page&quot; (which I would have preferred) as is displayed on CafePress. At the least, this disparity should be resolved. [[User:Ground|Ground]] 13:52, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''The following is a draft of a press release that we're working on.  Please comment and/or edit.  The release date will be, approximately, January 12.  Thanks. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]'''

A community-created encyclopedia project, Wikipedia
( http://www.wikipedia.com ), is celebrating its first anniversary (&quot;Wikipedia Day,&quot; January 15) by announcing that it has created over 20,000 articles. Remarkably, the articles are reasonably well-written and concise.  The quality of older articles continues to benefit as new writers join and contribute to this free, and freely-distributable, database of knowledge. 

The founders of Wikipedia are Internet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales and philosopher Larry Sanger.  Wales' Bomis.com search engine has supplied the financial backing and other support for the project, and Sanger, who earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Ohio State in 2000, has led the project.  Sanger and Wales attribute Wikipedia's success to the presence of a strong core group of well-educated, articulate contributors from around the world who together maintain community standards of quality and neutrality.  &quot;Participants all keep a watchful eye over the 'Recent Changes' page,&quot; Wales said.  &quot;They edit each others' work constantly.  It seems surprising that it works very well, but it does.&quot;

The project began life as an offshoot of its more academic sister project, Nupedia ( http://www.nupedia.com ), but has long since overtaken it in terms of size.  After a modest, quiet beginning in January 2001, Wikipedia announced 10,000 articles the following September and claims to have doubled that number in the past four months.  This growth and the project dynamics have been the subject of articles in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Magazine,&lt;/i&gt; and MIT's highly-respected &lt;i&gt;Technology Review,&lt;/i&gt; as well as technology news websites such as Slashdot and Kuro5hin.

At present, nearly 200 people are working on the project daily, from all around the world.  Everything, even this, has been through the wiki project, edited by the community.  But how can so many people with so many different backgrounds collaborate with no oversight?  From the beginning, Wales and Sanger believed that it was absolutely necessary that all participants be committed to what they call &quot;neutral point of view&quot;: rather than taking stands on issues of controversy, participants work together to prepare descriptions of the controversy that are fair to all points of view.  Sanger explains: &quot;If we were to permit Wikipedia to take controversial stands, it would be virtually impossible for people of many different viewpoints to collaborate.  Because of the neutrality policy, we have partisans working together on the same articles.  It's quite remarkable.&quot;

What motivates a scholar to participate in such a wide-open project? [Name here], of [position], explains: &quot;we need a good quote here from somebody like Michael Tinkler, Axel Boldt, Ruth Ifcher, JHK, LDC etc.&quot;

The software that currently powers the project, Clifford Adams' ''UseModWiki'', is based on the &quot;WikiWiki&quot; concept invented by Ward Cunningham, which allows anyone with an Internet connection to edit any article.  

Wikipedia is released under the GNU Free Documentation License, which ensures that anyone may reuse the entries on the site in any way they wish, including commercially, as long as they too preserve that right in their own versions.

Sanger has been invited to speak about Wikipedia at the Stanford University Computer Systems Laboratory colloquium on January 16; the press is invited to attend or to view the talk via the Internet.  Please see http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/ for details.  Sanger may also be reached (until Jan. 20) at 702-631-7301 or by e-mail at lsanger@nupedia.com .  Wales can be contacted at 858-274-8344 or by e-mail at jwales@bomis.com .

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think you should send this press release (via e-mail) to worldwide publications (via e-mail, of course- save paper). People who live around the world, should list computer (and newspaper) publications that they think might give Wikipedia a few lines, or even an article. I've started the list with some publications from Australia - [[Mark Ryan]]

* Australian PC World Magazine (http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au) Circulation ~60,000 people   Editor: Amanda Conroy   Email: Amanda_Conroy@idg.com.au

* Australian PC User Magazine (http://www.pcuser.com.au) Circulation ~55,000 people  Mailing Address: G.P.O. Box 4088, Sydney, N.S.W., 1028, AUSTRALIA.

----
I think we should mention Clifford Adams and UseModWiki. I know we're switching over to new software (anytime now, right? ;) but I think Clifford and his software deserve some credit for Wikipedia's success. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
----
I agree with the above. I think that the &quot;NPOV&quot; policy is totally misguided, as presented: I don't think it's necessary at all for people to try to present all sides of a story, but only to present statements which can be (or are) backed up. I think that the &quot;present all sides of the debate&quot; attitude makes too many articles become &quot;people debating about topic x&quot; instead of &quot;topic x&quot;. 

In addition to mentioning 200 core editors, you should also mention how many total people have edited, and what the visitor traffic is and at what rate its grown. Add more numbers and percentages.

You should also mention what you consider to be an article, to note that the 20,000 refers only to &quot;quality&quot; entries.

The GFDL should also be prominently mentioned. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

----
I agree, the license issue deserves its own paragraph, mentioning the relation to the free software development model and licenses. For instance:

:''All Wikipedia content can be freely modified and distributed under the GNU Free Documentation License, a license which shares many features with the license used by popular free software projects such as Linux. Wikipedia's wide open development model is also rather similar to that of open source software.''

I would not refer to the 20,000 articles as &quot;quality&quot; entries, because of the many counterexamples. 

The article talks about &quot;Wikipedia's modest success&quot;. I think the term &quot;modest success&quot; is sometimes taken to mean &quot;limited success&quot; or &quot;not very much success&quot;. I'd just say &quot;Wikipedia's success&quot; and be done with it. This is a press release after all; some exaggeration is allowed. If you had asked any pundit in January 2001 &quot;What would you define as critera for &lt;&lt;success&gt;&gt; of Wikipedia in one year?&quot; I think those criteria would have been met.

As to what motivates me to contribute: the same that motivates me to work in academia: it's fun to teach, it's fun to learn, it's fun to interact with intelligent people.
--AxelBoldt
----
Well, it looks like you just got your quote from a scholar, Larry! And I agree with all of the above. Except that I think perhaps the first sentence could be rephrased to pack a little more punch. How, I don't know. --[[Seb]]
----
Thanks for the comments.  Keep 'em coming.  Bear in mind that the purpose of the press release is to get people in the press to write about Wikipedia, not to write a complete article introducing Wikipedia. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
I changed ''Jimmy Wales and philosopher Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia.'' to &quot;The founders of Wikipedia are Internet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales and philosopher Larry Sanger.&quot;  I think that sounds better than before, but it changed the meaning a little bit.  Change it back if you want :)

----
I second the applause for Alex's quote, as I chuckle at the thought of the word &quot;scholar&quot; having been indirectly associated with me, a professional dilettante and dropout of three different colleges. :-)  [[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]
----
You might want to mention that even this press release has been through the wiki process...  I don't know how or where you'd put that though...  --[[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]]
----
I suppose any hack worth their paycheck would know how to find Slashdot and Kuro5hin, but it might be worth assuming that they know nothing...
----
A press release should pretend it's not a pess release. Maybe the sentence &quot;Even this press release has been through the wiki project, editing by the community.&quot; should be deleted. [[user:joao]]

Is this better?  It's a bit more ambiguous about whether this is a press release. [[w:Dreamyshade]]</text>

I think this page gives its topic rather more attention than it deserves.  It's just not that important.  Anyway, you're absolutely right: I do not care if people can see what pages I've deleted.  They can look in the history of the &quot;page titles to be deleted&quot; page if they're interested.  I'll edit that page accordingly. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
Since you feel that it's okay to tell people to look at the history, is it okay if we maintain a page which lists that same information, but organized more efficiently? --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
No. --LMS
----
Why?
----
Yes, why?
----
Because we have better things to do with our time. --LMS
----
Don't worry, you won't have to work on it.
----
OK, look, Cunctator, this is getting ridiculous.  As I said, I really ''don't'' care if you do this, but I do think it is a waste of the time of anyone who does do it.  But if you insist on spending your time in this way, go ahead.  Just put it on a regular Wikipedia page, linked &quot;quietly and unobtrusively&quot; as it were.

For others reading this: what I don't like is Cunctator putting such a list on his personal page so that he can accuse someone of tampering with his personal page if anyone wants to remove it.  That constitutes an end-run around what should be an open, consensus-based process.

Moreover, frankly, I very much suspect that this is primarily just a stupid, silly continuation of Cunctator's evident grudge against me for (repeatedly) deleting a page of his, which (again, on a subpage of his own personal pages) archived a bunch of totally asinine front page vandalism.  This created a totally nonsensical controversy in which Cunctator essentially accused me of acting like a bully and an autocrat for deleting his vandalism archive, and in which I and others eventually concluded that Cunctator was acting like a troll--which, I'm afraid, I ''still'' think he is doing, even on this very page.  This explains my hostility toward him, in case you were new and didn't know this already.

I have absolutely nothing to hide when it comes to my page-deleting.  I'm very happy for it to be public knowledge what pages I do and do not delete.  This would ''certainly'' include pages that The Cunctator has written.  I resent Cunctator's insinuation, above, that everything ''might not'' be above-board, as if there were a serious need to rescue our reputation on this score.

By contrast with that, it ''is'' reasonable to suggest that there needs to be public oversight of page deletions, for the very small reason that it ''will'' help newcomers to understand, to a very slight extent, that the project is open.  I think people can and do trust that I and Jimbo do a good job of this, but for those who do not, it's a good idea that there be at least some way to see what pages have and haven't been deleted.  That's given in the history, anyway.  I am skeptical that going to the extent of having a carefully-maintained directory of pages that have and have not been deleted is would be anything but a waste of time.  I also think that it would be a badge of honor, to some extent for some vandals to have a lot of pages listed there.

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

First off, I'd like to say that other than the characterization of this as a personal grudge, which I reply to below, I admire LMS's stance on this matter.

I don't have a grudge against LMS for that. I don't even have a grudge against LMS. I do feel upset that with great frequency he characterizes my intentions as a personal attack on him, that he minimizes my concerns, and that he belittles me personally.

But that don't feel the same way about him. Rather, I simply want to be able to feel as if contributing to Wikipedia is worth my effort. If I were able to not have any qualms (or even fewer) about making contributions, I would do more.

:For others reading this: what I don't like is Cunctator putting such a list on his personal page so that he can accuse someone of tampering with his personal page if anyone wants to remove it.  That constitutes an end-run around what should be an open, consensus-based process.

I'm sorry; when I wrote &quot;Bad idea: Delete a list of such entries from someone else's user page.&quot; I didn't mean to imply that changing the user page was the big problem, though when LMS later changed the above opinion to reflect his opinion, that did upset me. I thought it was a bad idea to delete the list at all, not to delete the list from my userpage. I wasn't trying to make an end run around a discussion process, as should be evident by my creation of this page. 

Re:  &quot;an end-run around what should be an open, consensus-based process.&quot; I believe LMS is making a distinction between discussing Wikipedia issues (open, consensus-based) and making decisions about Wikipedia issues (LMS). If that is the case, his language is slightly unclear.

Finally, LMS claims &quot;I resent Cunctator's insinuation, above, that everything ''might not'' be above-board.&quot; Where is this insinuation? The &quot;above-board&quot; paragraph is taken directly from a previous LMS statement. It was he, not I, who made any such insinuation. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
I was going to make various responses to the above, but in the larger scheme of things, I think that would be counterproductive.

Cunctator, if you want me to be convinced that you have no personal animus toward me, and you want to work in a friendly fashion with me, you would remove the &quot;good idea&quot;/&quot;bad idea&quot; comments from your page.  You might indeed think all those things, but it is formulated in a way that I find very insulting.  I know you will say that I shouldn't find it insulting since it's merely your honest opinion.  But in fact I ''do'' find it offensive; and polite people, of course, respect other people's feelings.  Also, you would remove the &quot;Bias Talk&quot; subpage from your page.  You have never explained why you have that up there.  You would also remove [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/User:The_Cunctator/How_to_destroy_Wikipedia this discussion], which remains, in my opinion, an unfair and misleading description of a situation now long since past.

If you were to do these things, it would be much easier to believe that you have no grudge (sorry about that word, but it certainly does seem that way to me) toward me.  And then it would be much easier for me to work politely with you.  I certainly would prefer that.  In fact, I prefer that, or that you completely leave the project, to your staying and continuing on the way you have been. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
It would be much easier for me to work politely with LMS if he didn't use phrases like &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;waste of time&quot;, &quot;stupid, silly&quot;, &quot;grudge&quot;,&quot;totally nonsensical&quot;, &quot;troll&quot;, &quot;various mistakes&quot;, &quot;screed&quot;, and &quot;breathtakingly unfair, and basically clueless&quot;. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
----
All of those epithets were ''richly'' deserved, however.  You make it sound as if I were being ''unfair'' to a generally upstanding member of the community!  I've toned down my most recent comment: how's that?

I'm sure I wouldn't use such words so much to describe your behavior, C., if you would do as I request, and if you would start acting more politely.  You'll notice that I do not use such epithets to describe many other members--just you.  That's because of ''how you have been behaving.''

And how about commenting on the substance of what I said?  About those nasty pages, the likes of which no other member of Wikipedia continues to have--just you? --[[LMS]]
----
If I might interrupt this charming and useful exchange of compliments to return to the topic of this page, it might be worth mentioning that, in this software, 
* for sysops (LMS), there's a &quot;delete this page&quot; button on every article page.
* every such deletion is logged at [[Log:Page Deletions]], a page that is for everybody to see and cannot be edited except by altering the MySQL database directly.
The page is currently empty here. See [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/wiki.phtml?title=Log:Page_Deletions] for an example. --[[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]

Hi all -- I think that Larry has a valid concern regarding vandals, but I have to say that I see a real value in a deleted pages page.  It would be nice to look at a list of ddeleted pages (for other than spelling errors) and see why -- it would give more examples of acceptable nomenclature and insight into  changes in nomenclature norms over time.  Similarly, it would let people see real examples of subjects that really are dictionary topics, or topics that the community feels (or felt) were unacceptable.  

Of course, this all presumes that people would actually take the time to go to the list of topics page and the deleted topics page to see what's been done before...

[[J Hofmann Kemp]], naturally idealistic historian running into a historian's inherent cynicism  ... ;-)
----
I want to make a comment about something I did, very deliberately, on [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_utilities/Page_titles_which_have_been_deleted the &quot;page titles which have been deleted&quot; page].  The Cunctator, for some strange reason, saw fit to list all the pages ''of his'' that were deleted ''by me'' on (he says, and I suppose it's true) Nov. 3.  Among these pages was--he invites you to consider the delicious irony--&quot;Page titles which have been deleted&quot;.  I do not actually find that ironic at all.  I find this to be a ''perfect'' example of the not-very-subtle trolling that C. continues to practice here.

This pointless game-playing, Cunctator, has to stop.  It obviously doesn't help the project.  Don't you ''care'' about that?  If you're still bothered, let's talk about it '''openly,''' not by playing these sort of games.  If you can't let it drop, let's talk about it.  Your edits, such as putting the pages of yours that I deleted on the &quot;page titles which have been deleted&quot; page, indicate that you are deeply disturbed about how I have treated you.  Let's get it out in the open, then.

In the interests of full disclosure, on said page, in the version that it seems I deleted, he ''originally'' listed a number of pages that I deleted.  It was, along with his &quot;reasons for deletion&quot; page and his additions to the &quot;vandalism&quot; pages, essentially a way for him to point out the ''awful, awful'' insult and harm that was done to him by my--what?--by my ''removing his archive of vandalism from his personal pages''!  That's what started all of this.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?

Come on.  We have better things to do with our time.  Don't we? --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
On the page &quot;Wikipedia utilities/Page titles which have been deleted&quot; I listed the page titles which have been deleted. 

I did not invite anyone to consider delicious irony or indicate that I am deeply disturbed about how LMS has treated me.

:Of course you didn't.  You try to be a little more subtle than that.  It's what makes trolling ''fun''!  :-)

I did not assert that any pages &quot;of mine&quot; (whatever that means; I recognize that I don't have ownership over any pages) were deleted by LMS. Rather, he's said in the past that several of the pages deleted on Nov. 3 were not deleted by him, and I believe him.

I'm being accused of &quot;not-very-subtle trolling&quot; and &quot;pointless game-playing&quot;? All I did was list the pages that have been deleted. This is not meant to impugn LMS. He said that he didn't mind if anyone saw what pages have been deleted; now it seems that he does. I'm confused. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

:Fine, fine performance this time, Cunctator.  I'd give that a 9 out of 10. --[[LMS]]
----
''The Cunctator moved the following from the main page after (attempting to) incorporate its arguments''

Should Wikipedia list deleted titles?

:I think the question itself is something of a non-sequitur.  &quot;Wikipedia&quot; doesn't &quot;do&quot; anything, individual people do.  Wikipedia is just a tool. The two meaningful questions, then, are (1) &quot;Should one or more individuals make a list of deleted pages?&quot;, and (2) &quot;Should one or more individuals delete such pages if they are made?&quot;  Frankly, I'm inclined toward &quot;no&quot; on both of those.  I see no value whatsoever in making such pages, but nor do I see sufficient harm to worry about them if they are made.  Of course since they are clearly neither encyclopedia articles nor essential Wikipedia structure or policy pages, they belong here in Meta if someone cares to make them. --[[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]
----
Cunctator, I am hereby deciding (and you are not welcome to change this back) that we are ''not'' going to attempt to list and represent various arguments on this issue.  The reason for my deciding this, in case it wasn't obvious, is that any attempt to do this will be closely participated in by you, and you, ''in my opinion,'' lack the ability represent various arguments ''fairly.''  I am just not interested in getting into an edit war with you about how different arguments on this should be represented and characterized.  Consequently, it is ''only fair'' that people like Lee should feel free to add their comments, unmolested, to the bottom of the page, and that the main text of the page should be attributed to you.  The latter, of course, is perfectly fair as well.

If you like, what you could do is add a notice to your section of the page saying, &quot;In the following, I will try to encorporate fairly what others, below, have said.&quot;  That would be grand. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
I find LMS's decision to be unfair and a bit cruel, so I've deleted the entry. I disclaim authorship of the entry, so if you want to stick your name wherever LMS put mine, feel free to do so and put it back up.

LDC didn't complain of any molestation, to my knowledge. --[[user:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

:No, I didn't.  That's primarily because I don't suffer from the problem of taking myself, or this project, or life in general too seriously. [[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]</text>

some moment you will have to face fact that the nature of Wikipedia is open to styles and purposes wich differ from yours. And that that is a good thing!

that has nothing to do with neutrality or objectivity, but with the simple fact that people differ in style. I think you throw away the child with the bathwater (Dutch saying) if you are so judgemental about this. Pretty sharp through the corner (another Dutch saying): even the vandals are committed to this project

You wrote to Seb:&lt;BR&gt;
''If you're really here mainly for the talk page discussions, I think that's a serious problem.  Why not just go to Usenet?  Why bother us here on Wikipedia with it?''&lt;BR&gt;
why is that a problem? why is it a bother?&lt;BR&gt;
I think you are missing out on people in this way because, if you like it or not, Seb, and people like me and Cunctator, are committed, ''very committed''. It's quite evidently not your style, you are even personally offended by it. I think that that is unneccesary and a pity.

Larry, please believe me that I fully support your role in the Wikipedia - I even believe that Seb and the Cunctator support you in this. I ask you please to reconsider the way you judge and ostracise other styles. Some people (like me and Cunctator) won't be trolled away, but I think other 'trolls' (as you like to consider them) will lose gusto, while they '''might''' have been valuable contributors (like Jzcool who started as a 'vandal', but now is highly regarded)

Sincerely --Mathijs

I made this new page because my browser won't allow me to edit the [[Should_talk_pages_be_used_for_debating?]]-page
----
Mathijs, you seem to want to take me to task for failing to face up to the fact &quot;that the nature of Wikipedia is open to styles and purposes wich differ from yours.&quot;  As a generality, I know this and have cheerfully accepted it from the beginning.  But it is clear that you are trying to make a comment about [[Should_talk_pages_be_used_for_debating?]], and in this I think you have widely missed the mark.  My point of view expressed on that page is clear and delimited: talk pages, generally speaking, should not be used for debate-for-its-own-sake.  Now, if you would like to discuss ''that'' claim, feel free.  But that claim ''obviously'' does not entail that I am closed to styles different from my own, and your suggestion that I am is, frankly, insulting.

I hope you will reconsider your attitude and approach, Mathijs.  It is hard to take you seriously when you write things like this. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

I know allready that it's hard for you to take styles different from your own seriously. It is evident from your ad hominem attacks on several people and the terminology you use. I don't ask you to change your personality and purpose. I '''ask''' you to reconsider your attitude and approach. There is no such thing as 'debate-for-its-own-sake'. Everybody has his motivation for his actions. Maybe it's hard for you to fathom, but I've got the highest respect for you and I'm putting serious effort into this. All the better that it is insulting to you for perhaps some will pour through into your self-righteous, bony brain. Allthough in your case you will be more concerned with your ego and image, than what the 'insult' may give you as a feedback to '''grow up'''. Wich would be a missed chance, because you are a public figure in this project (like a mayor or another politician). Again, in other words, we don't need to agree to support eachother, we don't need te be nice to give an opportunity to better the world we live in. I'd like you to have some respect, maybe you'll get it. Good luck --[[Mathijs]] 

:I'd be happy to lob some epithets your way in return, but I'm rather tired of that. --[[LMS]]
----
LMS: you ask: ''If you're really here mainly for the talk page discussions, I think that's a serious problem.  Why not just go to Usenet?  Why bother us here on Wikipedia with it?''&lt;BR&gt;

Well, Usenet discussions are harder to follow; they cannot provide neat links the way Talk pages can; and the fact that Talk pages are subordinate to a specific item helps keep the discussion on-topic. But I agree that discussions that are not directly relevant to the goal of improving the article should be kept separate from those that are. Having something like a /Debate page could be useful in that respect.

All right, I know what you're going to tell me: Our goal here is to '''build an encyclopedia'''. Anything that does not serve that goal should be weeded out, lest it encourage others to indulge in activities that do not serve our goal. Well, I think it is definitely clear that ''your'' goal here is to build an encyclopedia. But I think each person has his or her own personal goal in being here that may be different from yours. And they should be allowed to pursue those goals here, provided that it does not interfere with the overall goal of the project.

People are going to choose what they're going to do here. Those who like to input article content will do so; those who like to argue will do so. And those who like both will do both. Now if we want to keep the valuable ones who contribute to articles, shouldn't we try to find ways to keep them coming back?

Finally, one cannot help but wonder how the wealth of valuable knowledge that is  getting poured into the Wiki came into being in the first place. I'd like to venture a guess. I think a lot of it came from ''debate'', coupled with careful thinking and checking of facts. I value age-old, distilled, consensual knowledge as much as you do; but what I'm thinking is, if debate can make some of us wiser/more knowledgeable and possibly generate new, useful knowledge, and if the Wikipedia community can find ways to allow (and perhaps even cultivate) such intellectual activity, then in the long term it may well turn out to be one of its finest contributions to the resolution of humanity's ever-more pressing unsolved problems. (I know, it sounds grandiloquent, but everyone here thinks big, eh?) [[user:Seb|Seb]]
----
Seb, arguing with me is unfair to a certain extent :-) because I can make certain premises of my arguments true by decree.  I have decreed, and do decree, that our purpose is building an encyclopedia.  This is one thing that I have said pretty much from the beginning; in fact, I've been saying for a long time that it is one of a very few aspects of Wikipedia policy that is not under public debate or consideration.  It is one of the things that ''defines'' this project.  So, when you say,

:each person has his or her own personal goal in being here that may be different from yours. And they should be allowed to pursue those goals here, provided that it does not interfere with the overall goal of the project.

I reply: while people might have different ''motivations'' in participating, and it'd would be pointless and meaningless to try to control ''that,'' it is the essence of leadership to make sure that we are all engaged in the same task.  So, no.  People cannot come here and decide, without general community consent, that it's going to be a poetry forum and abortion debate club as well as an encyclopedia project.  There are other places on the Internet for that.  There is ''no good reason'' that Wikipedia should open its doors wide for people with all different sorts of ''purposes'' in mind for the project.

You seem to imply that we should tolerate lengthy, acrimonious, Usenet-style talk page debates because they attract people to the project; or, trying to get people to stop will lead them to leave the project.  First, I doubt this.  I think even those people love the idea of working on the encyclopedia, and would do so even if there were a strict rule against Usenet-style debates (it's hard to think of a better description of what I dislike).  But y'know, most of the people who engage in such debates endlessly are also the sort of people who write not-very-long but extremely biased texts.  I think the most productive members of the project ''do'' use talk pages, but they use them strategically, and they generally do not get drawn into debates that have little to do with improving the text of a page.  So, I'm sorry to say it, but on the whole, I suspect (I don't claim to know) that the project in general would be better off without these people.  I'd rather they change their behavior than leave, of course, and I'm certainly not suggesting that we kick them out.

I would disagree with you when you say that &quot;a lot of&quot; information poured into Wikipedia came from debate, if by that you mean anything like a majority of the information, the &quot;facts,&quot; cited in articles.  If you'll look at random pages, most of them are written with relatively little comment.  Huge long tracts are written--usually from a neutral point of view or something like it--with very little comment.  Have a look around--not just at topics like Christian anti-Semitism, abortion, God, etc.--and I think you will see that this is so.

But ''some''--a very modest amount--of information that is exchanged in debates does find its way into articles.  Not very much, but some.

--[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----
I was asking how that knowledge ''originally'' came into existence, not how it got poured into Wikipedia. [[user:Seb|Seb]]
-----
Larry: I agree with you that the primary purpose of Wikipedia is to produce an encyclopedia. However, I think that there is no reason why we can't use Wikipedia for other (secondary) purposes as well, so long as it doesn't interfere with its primary one.

Now, I know you are going to say &quot;why waste all this time engaging in pointless discussions that never go anywhere when you could be writing articles?&quot;. You may consider them pointless, or a waste of time. I'm sure you wish everyone spent every minute of their day writing articles :) But if people want to do things other than write articles, that's their right--its their time, and they can spend it how they please. The thing you can ask though, is that they do it in such a way that doesn't interfere with Wikipedia's primary purpose, making an encyclopedia.

So, basically, if you don't want people to debate on Wikipedia, you have to do more than just say &quot;this isn't what we are here for, guys&quot; -- you have to produce some evidence that it significantly gets in the way of people who just want to write articles. You have to show it has some significant detrimental effect on the project's primary purpose -- and that detrimental effect has to be more than just the fact that people debating could be writing articles instead. -- [[user:SJK_|SJK_]]
----
What he said. That's actually how I would have liked to write what I was thinking. -- [[user:Seb|Seb]]
----
First, I'm that you do agree with me that our purpose is to create an encyclopedia.

Second, I deny your premise, which seems to be something like this: unless I produce some (scientifically persuasive?) evidence that debate gets in the way of article-creation, then I am (what?) morally obligated not to complain about it.  (Or is it that I am not allowed ''by you'' to say others are disallowed? :-) )  Well, I can complain all I want, and I will continue to do so, for reasons I have rambled on and on about above and on other pages.  Of course, I'm not sure you're denying this, but then, I'm not sure what you ''are'' denying.

Anyway, sure, there's ''excellent'' evidence, perhaps not scientific evidence but evidence of a sort, that Usenet-style debate hurts the project.  It ''dilutes our sense of purpose.''  When people come here to get their fix of partisan rancor, rather than their fix of knowledge-contributing, it is a bit like a group of people coming here regularly to add dictionary definitions rather than encyclopedia articles.  Of course, the dictionary definition-writers are abusing our articles, and the Usenet-style debaters aren't, so you'd be right to point out that disanalogy; but where the analogy does hold, it's important.  Namely, both definition-writers and Usenet-style debaters are, by their behavior, giving others the idea, and reinforcing the idea in themselves, that the Wikipedia project might exist for some reason other than the creation of articles.

It's also not unlike why we delete entries that consist of single external links: failure to do so would make it seem acceptable that people add such entries; which in turn would lead people to adding many such entries; which in turn would lead to the content of Wikipedia being far too much like a web directory for any self-respecting encyclopedia project to want to be.  In this case, the analogy goes like this: people start debating on /Talk pages instead of working on articles; suppose nobody speaks out about it; then more and more people start debating rather than talking; then the project has become yet-another-debate-forum, rather than something really special, ''a bona fide collaborative encyclopedia project.''

You might, I imagine, want to reply to this by saying that we should try and see whether this would happen or not.  But see here, it is obvious to anyone such as myself who has been on the Internet for very long that when you get people chatting, then unless you restrain them (or they have an unusual amount of self-restraint), ''they will go at it'' hard and fast.  I don't want to do the experiment, thank you very much.

One of the things that makes Wikipedia ''great,'' and it is something that I have worked very hard to foster, is the fact that it is ''focused'' on a particular goal.  I think a lot of people underestimate the importance of our being so focused.

And, by the way, I regard it as one of my most important jobs, to keep us on track. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
----
I completely agree with Larry here. In addition to his arguments, I add this: we don't need to try it here as an experiment, as we can simply draw on the experience of the wider (and older) wiki community. On [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl MeatBallWiki], there's [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WardsWiki this page] which explores whether the original WikiWikiWeb is failing, and if so, why. Here's a particularly relevant quotation by Randy Stafford:

:I'd suggest a couple of causative factors. First has to be loss of focus (I know Sunir has pointed this out somewhere on Meatball before). The [[w:WikiWikiWeb]] was originally about people, projects, and patterns. It's not clear what it's about now. The pattern stuff that was on wiki's mind circa '95-'97 was pretty groovy. Then it took a turn for XP. Then it just kind of turned into a free-for-all.

Outside of the wiki world, I direct your attention to [[w:Everything2]], which also started out a user-written encyclopedia. Now it's... well, something rather different, to say the least.

Don't get me wrong; I'm very big on the importance of dialectic. But there are plenty of places on the Internet, including other wikis, where one can engage others in debate. Let's reserve this portion of the Internet for encyclopedia-building. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
----
Y'know what? If there were a small link at the bottom of articles or talk pages that said something like: &quot;Debate on &lt;article title&gt; (offsite)&quot; and led to a page in another Wiki-type site, I'd be happy to cut whatever I think constitutes debate stuff out from Talk or article pages, and paste it over there. I think it many of us would do it, because it would help us keep focus in a relatively smooth manner. [[user:Seb|Seb]]

As I've said before, I ''think'' that that, or something like it, is something that I could support.  I'd want to talk about it quite a bit more first, though.  You could set up a Meta-Wikipedia page to debate about it, Seb, or post to Wikipedia-L about it (or both). --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

==Discussion was started on [[Larry Sanger/Talk]]==

Hey Larry. I am one of the maintainers of periodic elements pages. I recently added links for each of the elements to a Los Alamos National Laboratory website that has great information (http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/default.htm). Earlier today I found this copyright notice: 

:''Unless otherwise indicated, this information has been authored by an employee or employees of the University of California, operator of the Los Alamos National Laboratory under Contract No. W-7405-ENG-36 with the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has rights to use, reproduce, and distribute this information. '''The public may copy and use this information without charge, provided that this Notice and any statement of authorship are reproduced on all copies.''' Neither the Government nor the University makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any liability or responsibility for the use of this information'' 

My question is this: Does this constitute that this work is in the Public Domain (or something similar) that can be re-copyrighted under the [[GNU Free Documentation License|FDL]]? Related question: Can an otherwise FDL document be forced to include such notices from source material? [[maveric149]]

::IANAL, but I was involved with some complicated negotiations regarding federally copyright material.  The answer to your question is no.  The reason for this long notice is precisely to get around the fact that the federal government can't copyright anything.  So what happens is that the federal government contracts a non-federal group to produce the data who then give the government the right to use the work.  In this case, the copyright belongs to the University of California who have put conditions on its use which are not compatible with the FDL. [[Chenyu]]

:I'm sure you're entirely correct about the positions of the lawyers on both sides, but let me clarify some of the other nuances of copyright law: Rule #1: Anyone can claim to own a valid copyright on anything, and since there's no downside to doing so, lawyers for the presumed holder of the copyright always claim all rights, regardless of whether or not they think they have any.  Rule #2: Even if the lawyers on the other side think the ones exercising rule #1 are just blowing smoke, they always advise their clients to believe the spurious claims, because if the lawyer is wrong, he can be held liable for contributory infringement, so &quot;just say no&quot; is the safe thing to do.

:In this particular case, the UC's copyright claim is almost certainly hot air, since it's very clearly a &quot;work for hire&quot; paid for with federal tax money.  The prohibition on the federal government on claiming copyrights ''does'' extend to works for hire, but that's a fine point that some judges can be bamboozled about. The lawyers on both sides know this, but the UC's lawyers still insist on claiming copyright and any lawyer you hire will advise you to take the claim seriously even if it probably will be thrown out of court eventually. So, the UC Regents (who are entitled to claim copyrights in general on stuff they create without federal funding) will continue to claim the copyright.  But the facts are probably that we can use the text legally since we already paid for it.  If we use the text, though, the regents might sue, and even though we'd probably win eventually it might cost too much to defend and federal courts don't general award legal costs for these kinds of defenses.  Such is the state of copyright law.  --[[Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

:::Unfortunately, you are almost certainly wrong in this case.  17 USC 101 (2001) defines a &quot;work of the United States Government&quot; is a work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties, which means that the exclusion of copyright in 17 USC 105 (2001) does not apply to government contractors.  17 USC 101 (2001) also defines work for hire and in this case, it's pretty clear that it isn't a work for hire.  (Works by contractors are not works for hire.)

:::Government contracts typically include a clause that explicitly states that the work done under the contract is not work for hire and that the copyright belongs to the contractor.   In the case of the Department of Energy the relevant regulations are in 48 CFR 927 (2001), and I have no doubt that if you look at the contract that was referenced, you would see that it contains standard language assigning copyright to the University of California, which is probably why they included it in the notice.

:::And I disagree about the behavior of lawyers and judges.  Federal judges generally know the law.  Also, when two sides agree on the law and the facts, the losing side generally gives in even if they have more financial resources, because federal judges will grant court costs if one side is obviously behaving badly.  If the law were clearly on our side, there wouldn't be a problem, because if the state of California wouldn't even try to sue.  Unfortunately, it isn't.
BTW, IANAL, but I learned what I did about federal contracting and IP as part of an effort to get information from the Department of Labor and the state of Minnesota (see my web site for details).  -- [[Chenyu]]


:Well, yes, it's a lot more complicated than I make it sound, but still I have to disagree: federal courts are frequently overturned on appeal in IP cases, often unanimously.  For one thing, courts often take things like contract terms and department regulations such as those you mention at face value, without considering whether or not they comport with Title 17, which is controlling authority.  The circuit courts have conflicting precedents about these matters, and many long-standing questions have yet to make it to the Supreme Court precisely because the &quot;public domain&quot; doesn't have good lawyers.  It's slowly changing: the EFF is taking some good cases (like getting the Sonny Bono act overturned), and the circuits are slowly coming around to agree more with them.  I'm not a lawyer either, but I've studied law and IP law in particular a lot, and it's a real mess.  --LDC

I say, if the author says its copyrighted under such and such conditions, we treat it as such. Even if the author is legally wrong, its better just to avoid the hassle of potential legal problems, and write the thing ourselves -- [[SJK]]

I'd have to agree with SJK here, but if it would save us a lot of work, maybe we should think more about it.  I'd like to see what Jimbo has to say, since ultimately he's the one who's liable. --LMS

Could we side-step this issue by having a /Sources subpage on each of the elements with that notice (along with a link to the original)? After reading the notice again, it seems like all they want is recognition for their work. Which seems to be similar to the GNU FDL which provides that authors of prior versions have to be acknowledged. [[maveric149]]
------
Something to consider in this case.  If what is being copied is physical data, then the
material is not subject to copyright.  LANL text about the element would be copyright, but
information about the physical properties of the elements is not copyrightable since facts are not copyrightable.  The key decision here is the Feist decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court which applied to telephone directories.

Also the big issue with the FDL are non-commerical clauses.  Restrictions on use which
prevent commerical use and resell of information are in conflict with FDL.  
The trouble is that 
the copyright notice is that it is ambiguious.  It could mean &quot;this information is
provided free of charge, do what you want with it&quot; in which case there is no problem.
It could also mean &quot;we give you permission to distribute this information for free, but
we withhold your right to redistribute the information for a fee.&quot;

But if you are copying physical data about the elements, there isn't a problem.  If you
are copying any commentary about the elements or anything original, then there may be a
problem.

Again, IANAL, but our web site redistributes information and in several cases we've
run into this issue. -- [[Chenyu]]
-----
Probably the easiest thing to do is to e-mail LANL and ask them what they mean by their
copyright notice.  If you are lucky, the person that wrote the page &quot;gets it&quot; and will
give you permission to include the data in the wikipedia.  If you are unlucky, then
the person that wrote the page &quot;doesn't get it&quot; in which case, it's probably easiest

for us to look for the information elsewhere. -- [[Chenyu]]
:I have already emailed the maintainer of the LANL webpages in question. That was a week ago, and I still haven't heard back from him. I will try again tomorrow. Visit [http://pearl1.lanl.gov/periodic/elements/1.html] for an example of the information that LANL provides. [[maveric149]]

----
That's probably the best idea, and I agree that [[Feist v. Rural]] at least does allow us to copy the bare facts, so we should do that as well--although you even have to be careful there: if the facts are specifically selected (i.e., they've chosen some specific subset of facts for expository purposes), or if they are presented in some specific order, they might have a claim on those editorial choices as being &quot;creative&quot; and therefore protectable.  The telephone directory case didn't have that problem because it was a simple alphabetical list intended to inlude everyone in a certain area, so there were no editorial choices made in presentation.  --LDC

I had to lie on the upload page: &quot;I hereby affirm that this file is not copyrighted, or that I own the copyright for this file and donate it to Wikipedia&quot;. In fact, I uploaded a Dutch version of the Wikipedia logo, which is a derivative of the Wikipedia logo, which is probably copyright Wikipedia. 

The disclaimer does not take into account:

* works that are already copyright Wikipedia

* works that are copyrighted, but come with a license that is compatible to the GNU Free Document Lincense.

Perhaps the disclaimer should read something like:

By uploading this file I declare not to violate any rights to this work, such as copyright. 

And then an explanation following in which cases the uploader can truthfully state the above if

* the copyright has expired;

* the maker uploads the work and transfers copyright to Wikipedia; or

* the work is distributed under a GNU Free Document Lincense compatible license.

(others)?

--branko

A few points:

* The maker does not always have rights to a creative work. They can give or sell them. An example of this is the publishing industry. If I write a book and give it to a publisher, I can't upload it to Wikipedia. So just say 'copyright holder' instead.

* Another possibility is if the upload constitutes fair use such as being a parody, short quote, etc.

:: Both correct, and all the more reason to have the uploaders state they are not violating property rights by uploading. Of course, if Wikipedia wants to own the rights it's a different thing, because a uploader cannot always give them away. Copyrights being what they are, I am not even sure you can give them away entirely or for ever (sometimes depending on the country the maker lives in).--branko

* You mispelled 'license'.

:: No, I did not. License is the correct British English spelling.--branko

Are the Congressional biographies at http://bioguide.congress.gov/ copyrighted? -- 165.121.117.xxx

: No, they are not copyrighted, nor can they be as federal material is not eligible for copyright protection.  (''See:'' [http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/105.html U.S. Copyright Act:  TITLE 17 , CHAPTER 1 , Sec. 105.] (Cite as 42 U.S.C., § 105).)  However, the images of the U.S. representatives which are used in the biographies may or may not be copyrighted.  (''See:'' [http://bioguide.congress.gov/copyright.htm Copyright Information for the Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress].)--[[user:netesq|NetEsq]]

I think there should be a page where articles with dodgy copyright status can be listed (and presumably fixed).  Otherwise the information lies forgotten in Talk pages.  Similar to the lists of pages for deletion, NPOVing etc.

:There already exists: [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion Wikipedia:Votes for deletion]. [[user:Andre Engels|Andre Engels]]

::How about pages such as [[Cologne]], which appear to be a mix of copied and original material?
::Seems like [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pages_needing_attention Wikipedia: Pages needing attention] is OK for this.

I'm suspicious of the validity of adding work to Wikipedia that's not coverable by the GFDL (as described in [[en:Wikipedia:copyrights]]). Isn't this a basic problem? -[[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

:Text would definitely be a problem, and I think we're pretty clear that we don't want text that isn't free.  But images really are a different case; I think &quot;fair use&quot; images are OK, because it's an easy distinction to make, the utility of Wikipedia would suffer greatly if we couldn't use such images, and using such images does not detract from the goal of creating our own text.

I don't know that it would suffer greatly; there are a bunch of public domain images out there, and Wikipedia is a great opportunity to encourage people to generate more. But I can see both sides of the argument.

On the other hand, I'm extremely uncomfortable about contaminating the Wikipedia feed with content that can't be used by downstream licensees. If we didn't use any GFDL content ourselves, then we wouldn't be limited by the GFDL conditions, but we do (or at least would like to be able to). 

Whatever the case, it's certainly not in the spirit of the GFDL to include non-free (the RMS def.) images.

I certainly think that it's ''crazy'' to imagine a legal setup in which image use as we do would be forbidden, but we live in a crazy world, with DRM around the corner.

Finally, &quot;fair use&quot; is, unfortunately, a defense. If someone challenges the use of their images, we would have to prove &quot;fair use&quot; in court, after the injunction. The fair use defense is sadly weak. --[[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

:In practice, if the copyright holder of an image complained, we would have to remove the image rather than attempt to defend our fair use rights.  Just as it would be a very bad idea to have non-free text, I think it would be a bad idea to have articles that ''depend'' on non-free images, and if you find such an article, it would be appropriate to call attention to that problem.  An image that's just an illustration to an otherwise complete article (like the video and album covers, for example) shouldn't be a problem, although you're right that it could be a problem for downstream use (although most such downstream uses will have the same fair use rights we do).

In my expert opinion, Cunctator's assumption that &quot;we would have to prove 'fair use' in court, after the injunction&quot; is mistaken:  The three elements a movant has to show to get a preliminary injunction are probability of success on the merits, threat of irreparable harm, and equity (or the balancing of the harms) favors the movant.  The movant bears the burden on all three elements and, before the court gets to them, bears the burden of showing there is no adequate remedy at law, or injunction will not lie.  Since someone complaining of copyright infringement could not make any one of those showings (let alone all four of them), they're never going to get an injunction to start with.  -- [[en:User:Isis|isis]] 07:25 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)


: We should probably move this debate to another page... I think it's ''vital'' that &quot;fair use&quot; images are marked as such. For example, if we later produce a paper snapshot of Wikipedia (the idea cropped up on the mailing list a while ago), we'd need to know which images we must omit. -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

= =

I don't understand the concept of &quot;'fair use' image,&quot; either by itself or in the context it's used in here.  The images we use under what we call the &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine are not copyrighted.  Here's what ''Black's Law Dictionary'' (4th ed.) says, and see if this makes what I'm saying clearer (italics added for emphasis &amp; citation omitted):
:'''FAIR USAGE.''' The doctrine of &quot;fair usage&quot; means that the matter which was under copyright was ''neither copied nor adopted'', but that the uncopyrightable underlying idea was used, since a theme or idea is not copyrightable.

What I don't understand is what &quot;which images we must omit&quot; is about -- I can't think of any situation in which any image in the 'pedia should be &quot;omitted.&quot;  Would someone please enlighten me? -- [[en:User:Isis|isis]] 11:26 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)

: I was thinking of album cover thumbnails &amp; sound clips -- wiouldn't a a CD or paper version of Wikipedia, even if sold at-cost, have to omit those? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

No, no way, never, huh-uh. -- [[en:User:Isis|isis]] 11:40 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)

:The only possible time such an image ''might'' have to be omitted is in a commercially sold reproduction of Wikipedia (that weakens our &quot;fair use&quot; position but probably wouldn't destroy it), and since we don't plan on ever doing that, it shouldn't be a problem.  If we made a paper reproduction distributed in accordance with our educational purposes, the same fair use rights would apply to that.

With all due respect, I must dissent from that opinion: Under ''Fed.R.Evid.'' 1001, for example, any copy of the 'pedia is interchangeable with any other (and/or the &quot;original&quot; -- whatever that means in this context), so whether we charge for our efforts in producing a particular copy or not is immaterial.

I've just realized what's been bothering some Users about the videotape covers: They don't understand what a copyright on the packaging means.  I should have caught on sooner and told them the fact they were missing to ease their minds: A copyright on a videotape cover design prohibits anyone else's making a ''videotape cover/box/package'' with that same (or too much like it) design, but it does ''not'' prohibit anyone's taking a picture of it to show to anyone (commercially or not) when talking about the content of the tape in that box.  If it did, the copyright laws would be unconstitutional, and those statutes are intended to further the 1st Amendment, not violate it. -- [[en:User:Isis|isis]] 20:20 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)

: Sounds like the matter is resolved (but Isis, note that we're dealing internationally here -- 1st amendment is a local thing) -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

I don't understand your point.  International copyright law is a matter of treaty, and in the hierarchy of authority, the Constitution is at the top, above treaties, and the copyright treaties don't change the &quot;local&quot; law in the various countries, anyway, they just make other countries recognize each others' &quot;local&quot; laws.  The videotape covers are copyrighted under U.S. law (either by statute or by treaty), and Wikipedia is in the U.S., so how do you imagine international law is some kind of issue?  Or is this another trolling expedition that I've mistaken for a pertinent comment? -- [[User:Isis|Isis]] 21:33 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)

:It is counter-productive to imply that another contributor is a troll just because they are posting an opinion. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

I didn't imply that he is, I asked him whether he is.  It's certainly one of the possible explanations for his condescending implication that he knows more about intellectual property law than I do, and one of the nicer ones, too. -- [[User:Isis|Isis]] 23:05 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)


: Isis, in matter of copyright &amp; legal stuff in general you know far more than I do. I think the matter of ''which'' countries copyright law applies has cropped up on the mailing list, but I can't remember what was said. Is there international copyright law? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 20:27 Oct 31, 2002 (UTC)

As I said three messages above yours, we're bound by U.S. copyright law -- that's all we have to comply with.  Other countries' laws are not valid/effective/applicable/binding within the U.S. (and ''vice versa''), and there is no higher authority (like the U.N. or something) that can make laws binding on any country, either.  Yes, there is conceptually such a thing as &quot;international copyright law,&quot; but not in the sense that there are statutes separate from the U.S. Code (which is the statutes passed by Congress).  The principles of international copyright law are laid out in the treaties between the various countries, and then each country makes its own statutes conform to what they've agreed to in the treaties.  That's why Congress made such drastic changes to our copyright laws in (I think it was) the 1980s, to bring the U.S. statutes into agreement with what our treaties promised.  So all we have to do is comply with the U.S. copyright laws, and we're automatically in compliance with international copyright law.  I can tell you some more about the hierarchy of legal authority in the U.S., but that's a side issue, and I can expand on what I've said here, if you want, but the bottom line is all we have to do is comply with the U.S. copyright law, and we're okay. -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 22:50 Oct 31, 2002 (UTC)


: We might in the future publish parts of Wikipedia in other countries, so we have to ensure that what we do is &quot;portable&quot;. It should also be made clear somewhere that the other language Wikipedias are also covered by US copyright law (since it is physically on the same sever -- is the location of the server the key point?). Jimbo has just said on the mailing list that he will write to Richard Stallman to ask about Fair Use. -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

I may be misunderstanding what you're asking, but Wikipedia has the right to do whatever it wants to with itself, including translating any or all of its articles and publishing them any which way/where it wants to.  So what is the concern about &quot;portability&quot;?  It can't be somebody else's infringing Wikipedia's copyright, and Wikipedia can't infringe its own copyright, so I'm sorry, but I don't understand what the potential problem is.  And whether the location of the server is crucial or immaterial depends on what kind of a problem it is, because the key location is where the rock injures someone, not where you were standing when you threw it.  -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 00:52 Nov 1, 2002 (UTC)

If we publish a CD-ROM or paper edition of wikipedia (for example), in a country other than the US then won't that country's copyright laws apply?

Well, I'm not a lawyer, so I'm going by very vague ideas here, but my point was: is it possible that US copyright laws allow us to do something which another country's does not (which would presumably cause problems were we to publish in that country). As a non-lawyer, I'm baffled by the interlational implications (if there are any): I write an article in the UK, and hold a copyright under UK law, but I license it to the US Wikipedia, which publishes under the GFDL in the US -- have I got that right at least? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 22:33 Nov 1, 2002 (UTC)
:You're probably right about what you're doing licensing your U.K. copyright to Wikipedia, because that's the way such things are usually arranged.  So why are you so worried about international implications, when you're in the middle of an international copyright situation that you see isn't any problem?  In fact, can you conceive of a regulatory system for protecting intellectual property rights that would make your situation easier for you than it is?

:Yes, it's possible that U.S. copyright laws allow us to do something another country's laws wouldn't, but if we were going to publish in another country, we'd find out what its laws were first.  If its laws were unacceptable to us and we had a choice, we wouldn't publish there; if we didn't have a choice, we'd have to publish there despite any less favorable terms in their laws.  (That's facetiously referred to as &quot;the common-law rule of 'tough'&quot;, as in &quot;That's tough.&quot;)  Either way, there's no sense in speculating about it now.

:It's also possible that Congress will change U.S. copyright laws (again) to not allow us to do something we can do now.  But since you can't know what's going to happen, you have to deal NOW with the situation as it is now and simply build in as much flexibility as you can so you can deal THEN with whatever happens then.

:Most &quot;problems&quot; in international copyright law have to do with enforcing copyrights across national borders.  Is Wikipedia ever going to try to enforce a copyright?  (&quot;No,&quot; I hear you answer.)  Then we're never going to have a problem doing so, are we?  So, since you can't even articulate what kind of a problem you're worried about, let's make a deal:  If you'll promise me to quit worrying about imaginary copyright issues and just concentrate on making the 'pedia as good as it can be, I'll promise to tell you if and when there is an actual copyright issue you should worry about on behalf of the 'pedia -- okay? -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 00:37 Nov 2, 2002 (UTC)

::which also means internationals just need to quit having any worries on cp too. We don't even have a page about cp ourselves, and what sense would it have to have one ? Do I understand well we are supposed to only respect US copyrights, not our country ones for now ? So it just make sense just to redirect our own policy on copyrights to the english one. None of us really know what your copyrights rules are anyway.

::3 questions (since they presented themselves):1)if one of us basically copy a text in a book in our language, is it an infringement in the US ? 2) If one of us translate (a good translation, not a rewording) a - say english - text, is our text an infringement in the US ? If our text is later translated back in english (so necessary different from the original, but similar enough that it can be made obvious where the new text come from), is that in infringement in the US ? 3)When somebody takes a text from a web site in our language, where nowhere appears the copyright word, what is the line we should follow ? Boldy delete, or rewrite ? If somebody is doing it frequently, claims the site not be copyrighted, and nobody cares about the rewrite, what should we do ? Just hope or delete ? If this text is translated in english, is it a copyright issue for the us ?

::You say we should not worry about imaginary cp issues that could happen later in other countries. You may be right it is a loss of time and energy right now. But, honestly, how can we just set aside cp issues in the countries where our language is spoken? Ours wikis are more likely to be published in our countries. Not necessarily in the US.

::all this said with all due respect : none of us know much about law, so we can't imagine what is implied. But, still, we feel &quot;a bit&quot; concerned anyway. [[user:anthere]]
NO, as a rule, people in other countries can NOT &quot;only respect US copyrights,&quot; and neither can Americans.  I never said anything in this discussion about U.S. copyrights -- if you look back over the discussion, you'll see that I referred always to U.S. copyright ''law'' (not to U.S. ''copyrights'') and, near the beginning of the discussion, I said, &quot;The videotape covers are copyrighted under U.S. law (either by statute or by treaty).&quot;

Under U.S. copyright law, violating a (legally valid) copyright is violating a copyright, no matter where it was granted, and under the usual &quot;conflict of laws&quot; principles, whether there was a violation would probably be determined under the law of the country where the violation took place (which is sometimes difficult to determine with computerized information).  So the bottom line is that contributors from outside the U.S. '''must follow''' their own country's copyright laws (which in many cases will be substantially the same as the U.S.'s because of treaties), and if the license or fair use of copyrighted materials is lawful under the law of the country that granted the copyright, then it will be lawful, under U.S. copyright law, for the Wikipedia to include that material.

I don't know what any other country's copyright law is, but in the instances you mentioned U.S. law is to the effect that:
* (1) Use of copyrighted text in any language IS copyright infringement.
* (2) Use of a translation of copyrighted text IS copyright infringement, no matter how many times it's translated.
* (3) Text created during the past about 20 years (and, thus, virtually everything that appears on the Internet) is copyrighted whether it says so or not, so you must assume that it IS copyright infringement to use it unless it specifically says it is not copyrighted.

:Point taken. However, I am confused here. Does a text stay protected for only 20 years. Or are you just making the asumption what we mostly have to fear would come from the internet, so likely to be less than 20 years. I thought the copyright lasted for a much longuer time, no ? When can we consider safe to pick up a text from an old book ? how old does it need to be for safety in most countries ?

::You're right that a copyright lasts a lot longer than 20 years, but that's not what I was talking about.  Back in the 1980s the U.S. changed its copyright law (to bring it in line with other treaty countries' laws) so that it was no longer necessary for copyrighted material to have a notice of copyright on it.  (Before that, if it didn't say it was copyrighted, it wasn't.  This is one of the main reasons I agree with you that the various countries' laws' getting more alike is often bad news.)  So for anything published in the U.S. since then, you have to assume it's under copyright unless it says it isn't, and that means virtually everything on the Internet. -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 07:17 Nov 3, 2002 (UTC)
The practice in the U.S. Wikipedia when one of us discovers an article (or part of one) that has been copied from a webpage (or printed source, for that matter, although that's rare) is to remove that material immediately, post a notice in its place that it has been removed for suspicion of copyright infringement (and include the URL for the website), and let the contributor  show either proof it is not copyrighted or proof of permission from the copyright holder to include it in the 'pedia -- and that does not apply only to webpages in English or originating in the U.S.  If the contributor does not do so, the material stays out; if a contributor keeps posting suspicious material without proving it's not infringing a copyright, that contributor is blocked.  This is an issue on which there is no room for negotiation: &lt;font color=maroon&gt;When in doubt, leave it out.&lt;/font&gt;

== Can copyrighted text stay in the history? ==

:OK. Is it necessary that the copyrighted text entirely disappear whenever possible (for example, in a new article, which can be deleted) or can it stay in the history ?

::This is a point on which reasonable minds could differ, and if I were representing a client, I could argue the other side with a clear conscience, but my own opinion is that the copyright text need not be removed from the article's 'history' page but should be removed from its 'talk' page.  I base this on primarily two factors.  The first is the definition of &quot;published,&quot; and I don't consider that we're &quot;publishing&quot; the history although we're publishing the 'pedia (and I really hope the history is not included in any paper, CD, or commercial on-line versions); I see the history as something the authors need to prepare the work, like any other editing tool, but that is not part of the published work.  (The 'talk' may be in the same category or may be considered (foot)notes and thus part of the &quot;published&quot; work -- that's not my decision.)

::My second reason is that having a record of everything we've deleted for possible copyright infringement proves we've been doing our best to comply with the applicable law.  That kind of evidence would prove all a copyright holder had to do was tell us, and we'd remove the material immediately, so making a federal case out of it was totally unnecessary. -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 07:17 Nov 3, 2002 (UTC)

Of course you can be interested in what changes there may be in the copyright laws of your own country and/or other countries (and good for you if you are), but that should not interfere with your working on the Wikipedia.  All you need do is comply with what the law is now where you are -- you don't need to comply with what it may be in the future (or what it was in the past, or what you wish it would be in the future).  The good news is: (1) copyright laws all over the world are getting more alike all the time; and (2) when there is a change, works that complied with the law when they were created, but do not satisfy the new law, are usually &quot;grandfathered,&quot; which means they are given permission to continue as they are, without having to change to comply with the new law. -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 07:25 Nov 2, 2002 (UTC)

: I personnaly don't find it a good new that copyrights are getting more and more alike :-), but that's only my opinion, and as such, of no interest for wikipedia cp issues. But, I understand the &quot;grandfathering&quot; point. Though I would not be surprised that the &quot;tolerance&quot; is different depending on the country.

== Wikipedia is a derivative work ==

[ '''N.B.''': Under 17 ''U.S.C.'' §101 http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/17/chapters/1/sections/section_101.html , Wikipedia is NOT a &quot;derivative work&quot; but a &quot;collective work&quot; or &quot;compilation.&quot; -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 09:06 Dec 5, 2002 (UTC) ]

An important consideration that Isis may be overlooking is that Wikipedia is bound by the strictures the GFDL places on derivative works. We want to be able to include material from other GFDL sources in Wikipedia.

We can only do that if Wikipedia satisfies the conditions the GFDL places on derivative works.

And the primary condition, even though it's not well-worded[1] is not to mix non-GFDL-licensible works with GFDL-licensed works. 

I recognize that photographs that an individual takes of copyrighted images are not the same as the copyrighted images themselves. Of course, in this case we also but up against trademark, but that's another kettle of fish.

::A painting, a photograph, etc. Art. As opposed to El Capitan, etc.

--[[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]
[1] Since the GFDL makes the assumption it's talking about a printed work. To discern the intent of the GFDL, which we shouldn't suborn, that's the right mode of thinking.
:If &quot;the GFDL makes the assumption it's talking about a printed work,&quot; then it IS talking about a printed work.  If you make the assumption that any writing means other than what it says it means, you're out of the field of law and into Wonderland.  Courts get to &quot;discern the intent&quot; of a writing, if that's at issue in a case before them, but persons (including non-human entities like Wikipedia) must follow the &quot;letter of the law&quot; which is what is written, given its ordinary meaning. -- [[User:Isis|isis]]

::Let me reword. The GFDL intends to cover any textual work, but is expressly designed to deal with the issues raised with printed works. Essentially, it's obvious with a textual work what the Document is and what it isn't. It's a bit vaguer with electronic text. Have you studied it?

== International copyright issues ==
It's arguable that Wikipedia is only covered by U.S. copyright, inasmuch as the publisher is US. However, since local copyrights are granted to authors in their respective nations, and authors do not transfer their copyrights to Wikipedia (they grant an non-exclusive license), there are certainly potential issues there.
:What &quot;potential issues&quot;? Saying there are issues without identifying them is like saying &quot;the sky is falling&quot; -- it may be so, but there's nothing in your posting that makes that more likely than not, since you haven't given even a hint of what kind of issues you want us to think there are.  You say it's &quot;arguable that Wikipedia is only covered by U.S. copyright&quot;; everyone knows it is, because I've just argued that.  Do you mean to imply it's arguable that Wikipedia is covered by any other copyright [law]?  If so, make the argument; if not, knock off the alarmism -- it's naughty to go around upsetting Wikipedians who are trying to comport themselves in the way the applicable copyright law requires.  -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 06:42 Nov 1, 2002 (UTC)

::In &quot;everyone knows it is, because I've just argued that&quot;, I assume you meant &quot;everyone one knows it's arguable that Wikipedia is only covered by U.S. copyright&quot;, not &quot;everyone knows Wikipedia is only covered by U.S. copyright&quot;.

::Okay, I'll try not to worry about it.

Moreover, and this is the important problem, from the perspective of the trade reps and trade organizations that are building the current system of international law, First Amendment and other Constitutional limitations on the scope of intellectual property are considered trade barriers. And these trade barriers are vociferously attacked. It is not a wise strategy to assume that limitations on US copyright law will remain there over the long haul. All trends point otherwise.
:Any problems of &quot;trade reps and trade organizations&quot; are, by definition, theirs, not ours.  We don't need to worry now about what the applicable law will be in the future.  We need only comply now with whatever it is now and comply then with whatever it is then. -- [[User:Isis|isis]] 06:50 Nov 1, 2002 (UTC)

::I'm talking about U.S. trade reps, too. It's true that from a liability standpoint we only need to worry about current law, but we also want to design Wikipedia practices for the long haul.

In fact, the US has already exceeded the strictures of the [[w:Berne Convention]] in terms of time limits. And the [[w:DMCA]],the [[w:WIPO Copyright Treaty]], and [[w:DRM]] are downright scary (though their absurdity does actually invite methods of subversion).

I'm glad to see this is a hot topic.  I need someone with a bigger gun than I have regarding copyright law to come look at the &quot;Hitler_has_only_got_one_ball&quot; entry on wikipedia and the associated talk page.  I've tried explaining how this page violates the wikipedia policy on song lyrics, on copyrighted works, on original material, on source material, and so on, but I'm not getting the danger of using copyrighted work across.

:I believe I'm as big a gun as Wikipedia has on issues of U.S. copyright (and I'm not too modest to say so), and this whole &quot;Hitler's balls&quot; commotion is what is called in the law a &quot;frolic and detour.&quot;  The lyrics are not copyrighted to start with, but if they were, Wikipedia could still quote them under the doctrine of fair use.

UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 17, CHAPTER 1 HAS ALL THE EXPLANATION YOU NEED ABOUT THE USE OF US GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. IT IS AS FOLLOWS:



Sec. 105. - Subject matter of copyright: United States Government works 



Copyright protection under this title is not available for any work of the United States Government, but the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.

IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING FROM CHAPTER 4:


Sec. 401. - Notice of copyright: Visually perceptible copies 


(a) General Provisions. - 

Whenever a work protected under this title is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on publicly distributed copies from which the work can be visually perceived, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. 

(b) Form of Notice. - 

If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the following three elements: 

(1) 

the symbol (AF) (the letter C in a circle), or the word ''Copyright'', or the abbreviation ''Copr.''; and 

(2) 

the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations, or derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and 

(3) 

the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner. 

(c) Position of Notice. - 

The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive. 

(d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice. - 

If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant's interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).

Sec. 402. - Notice of copyright: Phonorecords of sound recordings 


(a) General Provisions. - 

Whenever a sound recording protected under this title is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on publicly distributed phonorecords of the sound recording. 

(b) Form of Notice. - 

If a notice appears on the phonorecords, it shall consist of the following three elements: 

(1) 

the symbol P (the letter P in a circle); and 

(2) 

the year of first publication of the sound recording; and 

(3) 

the name of the owner of copyright in the sound recording, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner; if the producer of the sound recording is named on the phonorecord labels or containers, and if no other name appears in conjunction with the notice, the producer's name shall be considered a part of the notice. 

(c) Position of Notice. - 

The notice shall be placed on the surface of the phonorecord, or on the phonorecord label or container, in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. 

(d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice. - 

If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published phonorecord or phonorecords to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant's interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).


Sec. 403. - Notice of copyright: Publications incorporating United States Government works 



Sections 401(d) and 402(d) shall not apply to a work published in copies or phonorecords consisting predominantly of one or more works of the United States Government unless the notice of copyright appearing on the published copies or phonorecords to which a defendant in the copyright infringement suit had access includes a statement identifying, either affirmatively or negatively, those portions of the copies or phonorecords embodying any work or works protected under this title.

I HOPE THE ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION ON THE TOPIC.

===The USA has not honored the rule of the shorter term yet===
[[s:en:United_States_Code/Title_17/Chapter_1/Section_104A]](a) Automatic Protection and Term: (1) Term.—
:(A) Copyright subsists, in accordance with this section, in restored works, and vests automatically on the date of restoration.
:(B) Any work in which copyright is restored under this section shall subsist for the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in the United States if the work never entered the public domain in the United States.

Based on this wording, the USA '''has not honored''' [[Wikipedia:Public_domain#The_rule_of_the_shorter_term|the rule of the shorter term]] of the Bern Convention. As I administer English and Chinese Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikisource, multilingual Wikisource, and Wikimedia Commons, I now find this section more and more painful because:
#Once American law covers a non-American work for copyright restoration, it is legally copyrighted with American duration even if it is now in the public domain in its home country. 
#It is not always easy to ask the original copyright holders if they are willing to renounce American copyright while their home countries no longer copyright their works. They may become [[w:orphan works|orphan works]] in the USA.
#When a work is legally copyrighted in the USA even if it is orphaned, Wiki site users, even if outside the USA, cannot upload these works to Wiki sites unless they can claim fair use or prove that the original copyright holders have renounced American copyright to release these works into the public domain.

To make an example, if a work was originally published in China in 1930 by a Chinese author died in 1946, then based on Chinese copyright term of lifetime + 50 years, it would enter the public domain in 1997 in China, but as Chinese works are under American copyright restoration on 1 January 1996, such a Chinese work would be copyrighted in the USA through 2025. Since Wikisource cannot practically claim fair use on articles, the USA copyright law not honoring the rule of the shorter term is harming the development of Wiki sites. This is why as an admin of Chinese Wikisource, I have had to delete some Chinese public domain works while they are legally copyrighted in the USA.

For this problem, may I propose a petition, such as through http://www.petitiononline.com/ , to urge American Congressmembers to amend United_States_Code/Title_17/Chapter_1/Section_104A to accept the rule of the shorter term of the Bern Convention? Please understand that without American acceptance of the rule of the shorter term of the Bern Convention, all Wiki sites may suffer. In addition, we should also urge American Congressmembers to reconsider and pass the [[w:Public Domain Enhancement Act|Public Domain Enhancement Act]] so more orphaned American works will enter the public domain in at least the USA.--[[User:Jusjih|Jusjih]] 14:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

Are Wikipedias in all languages subject to American copyright law?  [[User:Ausir|Ausir]] 20:20, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC) 
::Yes, because Wikimedia Foundation is an '''American''' foundation and the United States have the fair-use law. -- [[User:200.193.53.92|200.193.53.92]] 00:40, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
:::But unfortunately, the USA has not honored the rule of the shorter term yet, so please see [[American non-acceptance of the rule of the shorter term]] for more information.--[[User:Jusjih|Jusjih]] 08:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

What is the legal ramification of using content from a country that has no copyright agreements with the US and is not signatory to any international treaties? Without copyright recognition, there can be no copyright violation, right? - [[User:KeithTyler|KeithTyler]] 19:29, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:Even though works from these countries, such as Afghanistan, are not copyrighted in the USA yet, be aware that should any of them enters any copyright agreements with the USA bilaterally or multilaterally, their works could become suddenly copyrighted in the USA. I would suggest:
#Unless works from these countries are too old to be copyrightable everywhere, such as by authors who have died for at least 100 years, it may become unwise to upload them to Wikimedia Commons should they enter any copyright agreements with the USA.
#Whether they enter any copyright agreements with the USA or not, fair use is still possible in English Wikipedia. [[w:Template:PD-because]] allows users to write in reasons why something is in the public domain. While it is possible to write in that a work is PD in the USA due to lacking copyright agreement, should the work becomes copyrighted in the USA, the tag has to be changed to fair use with rationales.--[[User:Jusjih|Jusjih]] 14:29, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of the '''Wikipedia cloning project''' is to define strategies and develop tools so that the distribution of wikipedia's content all over the internet be subject to the interests of the wikipedia community and to the GNU-FDL license. And to use a Wikipedia fork or mirror wiki during the Wikimedia/[[Wikipedia maintenance tasks]], so one able to save one´s  edits in the [[w:Wikipedia fork|Wikipedia fork]]. 

To serve the Wikipedia community best interests:

*the wikipedia content must be widely distributed
*the GNU-FDL license must be respected
*every article must have a link to correspondent wikipedia page
*unnecessary forking must be avoided

:I think &lt;b&gt;necessary&lt;/b&gt; forking should be easy and encouraged politely without creating unnecessary obstacles.  This is an essence of freedom, the ability to move on or elsewhere without abandoning previous investments involuntarily. [[user:mirwin]]

:I disagree. Forking should be easy, but discouraged because we trying to build an enciclopedia and for that we need some sort of central control. Forking is only a good thing if necessary.[[user:Joao]]

:: Perhaps we should move this discussion to the talk page and preserve this page for articulated points of [[w:consensus]].  I do not think we are that far apart in essence.  The GPL and FDL are about not restricting future users freedoms.  What if a free software project such as linux had a GPL'd code base that was setup such that modifying it inside the constraints of  the GPL was extremely difficult?  It might fail to attract contributors and thus fail for lack of interest.  If we wish to attract people who become &lt;b&gt;Wikipedians&lt;/b&gt;, they must be confident they can use a copy the community property to their own advantage in other places, projects, and applications. An example might be an introductory science text or engineering text.  Can a Wikipedia contributor or user download an article in a form to easily include it in a usemod wiki, other wiki, or cut and past text and attribtion  data while complying with the attribution requirements of the FDL? Another sample, which I need to add to the FAQ.  Is there a way to cut and paste material from one Wikipedia article to another Wikipedia while preserving the attribution information necessary to comply with the FDL? --[[user:mirwin]]

::A new [[w:argument]] (see also [[w:legal theory]]):  From http//:wikipedia.com submit button notice &quot;If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly and &lt;b&gt;redistributed at will&lt;/b&gt;, then don't hit submit.&quot;  The bold was inserted by me.   Consider that in the U.S. a legally enforceable contract has a meeting of minds and appropriate consideration in both directions or it can be set aside by a civil judge.   Clearly Bomis has the ability to &lt;/b&gt;redistribute at will&lt;/b&gt; as they are running several servers and/or wiki spaces.  It would seem to me that perhaps our implied contract requires us to provide similar &lt;b&gt;at will&lt;/b&gt; consideration to other stakeholders in the Wikipedia community.  [[user:mirwin]]
----

&lt;b&gt;To achieve these goals it is proposed that we:&lt;/b&gt;

*Draft, discuss and ratify a community charter.  We should keep in mind that wikipedia and its members are all part of other communities.  Perhaps if we get several operational scenarios and associated charters drafted we could take them to an appropriate public forum such as advogato.com, slashdot.com or somewhere on sourceforce or other forum where potential free developers and contributors hang out and invite public discussion to refine our alternatives.

*Organize a how to fork/mirror guide that first explores when and why to fork/mirror or not to fork/mirror.  This way if differences can be resolved appropriately much forking and loss of disgruntled contributors can be avoided.

*Reasonable guidelines can be developed and posted publicly so that all contributors know the risks of participation and the potential cost of departure with an instantaneous snapshot for forking.

*Release the database in several easy to download files. The articles must be released in an organized manner so that equally relevant be released in the same file. Articles Relevance can be established from the number of links the articles gets.

*Write an interface to the database that respects the GNU-FDL license, places a link to correspondent wikipedia page in every article and disallows editing to avoid unnecessary forking.

Would the immediately above be the &quot;invariant&quot; proposed on the mailing list? to me ([[user:mirwin]]), disallowing editing would seem to violate the essence of wiki and make the material harder to tailor for new purposes.

:You can always use the wikipedia software and databases to build another wikipedia. But it is a bad idea to make it easy, so that only people with a good reason to fork actualy fork. Disallowing editing would not violate the essence of wiki because  wikipedia clones are not wikis.[[user:Joao]]

::It is my opinion that making it difficult violates the essence of the FDL and limits the value delivered to customers and contributors alike.  Further, it may backfire in the following sense:   There are many free developers and a large pool of potential new contributors (to mutually self train as a pool of improving collaborative encyclopedists) around with the capability to recreate the essence of Wikipedia from scratch.  This project has clearly demonstrated the value in the approach to many with public and private agendas.  I think it is better to provide the freedom to leave easily and attract interested parties to contribute to our  project's success because it potentially benefits them and they see this clearly; than to provoke a fork out of possibly misguided concern that the local knowledgebase is not truly free and useful to other members of the larger community or ourselves in other free projects.

::Let me add that there are articles around that clarify this is not the intent of the project founders or the local community but that as a beginner here I did not find them easily.  I still have some concerns that the practical details have not been implemented or worked out yet, but it appears the development team is contemplating the problem and potential resolution methods.  It is my current view that this is a serious Research &amp;amp; Development effort and thus some confusion to new contributors is inevitable.  We need acknowledge the concerns and show clearly how we are working on these issues.

::The site has committed to meeting legal requirements on the front page and in press releases and with the submit button. You and I are attempting to agree on the level of ease appropriate and how important it is to our longterm success as a project.  Others will probably have opinions or know the current [[w:consensus]] of the community.  Hopefully others will chime in or point us to the appropriate summaries and ratification procedures or articles detailing or attempting to draft change proposal development and review procedures. -- [[user:mirwin]]

* Provide a comprehensive snapshot download capability that provides all necessary data to build a complete mirror/fork that is in compliance  with the GPL and FDL but which is provided on a first come first served metered basis which provides the information in a reasonable period of time but does not adversely affect the parent site.  

*Release periodic updates of the database to avoid the need of webmasters for downloading all files again.

*Look for collaboration from people that write CMS software like: PHPNUKE, PostNuke, Drupal and Scoop. Maybe Rusty from Kuro5hin be interested in hosting a wikipedia mirror. Or even SlashDot people.

----

We've been through half the discussion before on [[talk:SunirShah]]. As for Drupal, Dries incorporated a wiki-inspired permanent storage system into it last year, and Cliff managed to spooge UseModWiki into Scoop at one point. But I'm not sure what you mean by writing CMS software. ''Wiki''pedia is a CMS. I mean, what more do you need?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;i&gt;The following talk, titled &quot;What Wikipedia is and why it matters,&quot; was delivered to the Stanford University Computer Systems Laboratory
EE380 Colloquium, on January 16, 2002.  The colloquium can be seen at [http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/]; this is pretty much the same text that I have below, plus about a half hour of Q &amp;amp; A. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]&lt;/i&gt;

First, I'd like to thank Dennis Allison for very kindly inviting me to speak here today.  I'd also like to thank the Stanford Computer Forum for providing some support.

My topic is an online encyclopedia project that I co-founded and that I have been employed full time in helping to manage. The project's name is Wikipedia, and can be found on the web at Wikipedia.com.

On a friend's advice, I'm going to begin by explaining a bit about why you should care about Wikipedia at all.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia project. It's free--not just without cost, but free in the GNU sense. I'll explain some more later about that. We began work just one year ago (in fact, one year and one day--yesterday was our first anniversary). Since then, participants have added well over 20,000 articles. In the past four months, we have doubled our number of articles. Also in that time, the project has been the subject of focused news coverage by The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, MIT's Technology Review, and a variety of other sources in the international press. The project has also been favorably mentioned on National Public Radio and the Associated Press. We've also been Slashdotted a few times.

What's remarkable is that Wikipedia has received all of this attention, and has made all of this progress, in spite of--or perhaps because of--the fact that it is completely open to any contributor. Wikipedia is a WikiWikiWeb, which means that anyone can go to any page, click on a link that reads &quot;edit text of this page,&quot; and proceed to edit the article. After doing some copyediting, or adding a few new paragraphs of information, one simply presses the &quot;save&quot; button, and the changes to the article have been made. The editing is automatically logged on a &quot;Recent Changes&quot; page that participants monitor closely. If someone sees something inane, false, biased, or otherwise defective, he or she can quickly and easily change the text.

I think Wikipedia is, therefore, an excellent example of a new kind of website: a radically collaborative, truly open website, that actually produces content that the general public might want to read.

All right. Now, everything I've said up to this point has been introductory. The rest of this talk is divided into two parts, the first part being a discussion of some leading characteristics of Wikipedia, and the second part being some further discussion about why, on various different levels, you should care about Wikipedia.  The first part is much longer than the second part.  You should be aware that the talk as a whole is not intended to be particularly technical or academic; my main interest here is to introduce you to Wikipedia.  I think that just describing it and making a few bold claims about why it's important should be thought-provoking enough.


== What Wikipedia is. ==

So, what exactly is Wikipedia?

There are three essential characteristics of the project that together define its niche on the World Wide Web: it is a WikiWiki, it is an encyclopedia, and it is open content (or free). I'm going discuss these points in turn.

First, Wikipedia is a WikiWiki. What exactly does that mean?  I am told that the word, &quot;WikiWiki,&quot; or just &quot;wiki&quot; for short, comes from a Hawaiian word for &quot;quick 
information.&quot;  Now, there's some disagreement about what constitutes a wiki, but basically it's a software application that allows people to collaborate on the writing of an entire website, without any central editorial mechanism necessary. Participants just go in and edit any page they want, whenever they want, working at their own pace.

Let me give an example of how you might edit a page. As I said, wiki software essentially allows anyone to go to the wiki website and edit any page. So, for example, suppose I go to a certain page about philosophy, and I see two problems with the page: there's a spelling error, and the page doesn't discuss some pet topic of mine. I feel inspired to write an article about that topic. So here's what I do. I press the &quot;edit text of this page&quot; link. Up pops a text box; I scroll down to the spelling mistake and correct it. Then I find a place to add a link to a new article. Say there's some discussion of political philosophy and freedom as a political concept, and I want to talk about so-called negative freedom. So I add a sentence or two that explains the distinction between positive and negative freedom, and when I write the words &quot;negative freedom,&quot; I enclose them in double brackets--first two left brackets, then the words &quot;negative freedom,&quot; then two right brackets. Then I save changes to the article. Then I'm presented with the article again, but now with the changes I just made. Since there is not yet an article called &quot;negative freedom,&quot; there is a little blue question mark after the words &quot;negative freedom&quot; that I typed. So I click on that little blue question mark and I arrive at another text box, which invites me to write something. So I do. I expound and I excogitate and then I press the &quot;save&quot; button. So now I've edited one article and I have created another article. Both of these changes are recorded in a publicly-viewable &quot;Recent Changes&quot; log. Other people can observe the changes I made and, if they want to make some further changes, they can. That's basically how it works.

I really don't have enough time to explain the history and culture surrounding WikiWikis, but I would certainly be remiss if I did not mention that the man who is responsible for the original wiki is Ward Cunningham, who has co-written a book called &quot;The Wiki Way.&quot; You can see the very first wiki, which is still one of the largest and most active, if you follow a link from c2.com. I'd also be remiss if I did not make it very plain that the online culture surrounding Wikipedia is quite different from the online culture surrounding most other wikis. For more details, I would recommend a visit to c2.com.

This brings me to the second point. The Wikipedia project is self-consciously an encyclopedia--rather than a dictionary, discussion forum, web portal, etc.--or even just a typical wiki. Quite a few other wikis do not have any very explicit purpose. They are, their hosts say, whatever the participants want them to be. As a result, as you might expect, those wikis often end up being nothing in particular, and generally just another way to conduct online discussions. Now, I don't mean this as a criticism of other wikis--indeed, wikis have a very interesting, refreshing openness and cordiality that Wikipedia shares in. I'm just trying to distinguish Wikipedia, which has a very specific purpose--to build an encyclopedia--from other wikis, which in many cases do not have any such specific purpose.

Actually, there is a bit of a tension between the facts that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia project and that it is a wiki. When people arrive at the website and see that they can edit any page, and that there is little central oversight, it is immediately evident that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia only because we decided to make it one. The website, when we first set it up, was just a blank slate. It required myself and some other people to declare, &quot;We're making an encyclopedia here on this wiki&quot;--we had to make that declaration repeatedly in order for people to know that indeed, we wanted to make an encyclopedia. We could have instead made a poetry forum, a dictionary, or a chat area. But we didn't want to. We wanted it to become an encyclopedia, and that is what it has become.

You might be skeptical, however, that a wiki could produce a reference work that would deserve to be called an encyclopedia. In that case, you would think that &quot;wiki-based encyclopedia project&quot; would be something of an oxymoron. I'll address that objection shortly. Before I do that, though, I want to present the third defining feature of the Wikipedia project. So far, I've said that Wikipedia is a wiki and that it's an encyclopedia.

It's also essential to note that the content is all open content, or free in the GNU sense. Wikipedia contents are released to the public under the GNU Free Documentation License. This license works, roughly speaking, as follows. Text and media are licensed by the copyright holder to the general public, permitting anyone to redistribute and alter the text free of charge, and guaranteeing that no one will be able to restrict access to amended versions of the content. An open content, or free content, license is intended to guarantee that all of the content stays free forever. If we were simply to declare that the contents are in the public domain, then anyone could come along, make some slight changes to the text, and then copyright that, preventing others from using their slightly-changed version.  We want to prevent that from happening.  As you can see, the concepts are much the same that you've encountered in the open source or free software movement.

You might not guess this immediately, but it is very important that Wikipedia is open content. It's important for two reasons. First of all, Wikipedia's contributors--called Wikipedians--understand that their efforts will be freely distributable forever. That is, I think, one of the main incentives they have to participate. If the organizers of the project were instead to claim the content for themselves, and not release it freely, the participants would have the sense that they were merely working for someone else's gain. But since the content is free, contributors instead have the sense that they are working for the benefit of a worldwide audience. And they are!

The second reason it's important that Wikipedia is open content is that this helps to make the project an institution that can take on a life of its own. If, for whatever reason, the organizers can no longer support the project--we definitely don't expect that to happen, by the way--then others can pick up where we left off, if necessary. There is no reason that Wikipedia's content ever needs to, as it were, sit on someone's shelf, gathering dust, as traditional encyclopedias have done. It's because it's open content that the world is free to continue to develop it. I think that's a great thing. It portends great things for Wikipedia and for its sister project, Nupedia, in the future. Though Wikipedia has 20,000 articles now, the quality of the articles is admittedly uneven--while we have a lot of rather good articles, we also have a lot of articles that need work. (Wikipedians are very honest with themselves about this, by the way.) But what about in ten or twenty years? To take that question seriously--&quot;What about in ten or twenty years?&quot;--requires that we assume that the project is going to exist in ten or twenty years. Few things in this life are certain, but we can rest a lot more assured that Wikipedia will still exist in ten or twenty years precisely because it is open content. A lot of people care about this project, and the license guarantees that it will stay free to continue to develop.

So, indeed, what will happen in ten or twenty years?  It's hard to say for sure, but if we continue on as we have been, it seems pretty likely that we will have hundreds of thousands of articles, and that the older articles, at least, will be very long and very well-developed, having been mercilessly edited by many different people. Some of us in the project have suggested that Britannica and Encarta have something to worry about--which, of course, sounds ludicrous right now.

Next, let me talk about the growth of the project, because I think a certain bit about that might be of some interest to you. As I said, we began a year ago, on January 15, 2001. The project was originally going to be a side-project for Nupedia, which is also a free encyclopedia project I manage; Nupedia, unlike Wikipedia, is very carefully peer-reviewed, and managed mainly by academics with Ph.D.'s. Nupedia's advisory board did not want Nupedia to be associated with a wiki. So Wikipedia was born as a separate project but still had the distinct benefit of the participation of a number of well-educated Nupedia contributors. So, after a few months, we had created over a thousand articles. As the months passed, the pace of production increased. We announced having over 6,000 articles in July, which would be about a thousand articles created in a month; in September we announced having 10,000 articles, which indicates that between July and September we were creating 2,000 articles per month. Then, between September and the present, we have, we estimate, created another 10,000 articles, which indicates that in that time, despite the holiday slowdown, we were creating something like 2,500 articles per month.

I and the other project organizers have a theory as to why Wikipedia traffic has increased. After reviewing our referrer logs last summer (I think it was), we observed that the Google search engine had been sending us a growing amount of traffic, and since then, Google has continued to send us increasing amounts of traffic. We believe that we are, happily, in a positive feedback loop with Google, as follows. We write a thousand articles; Google spiders them and sends some traffic to those pages. Some small percentage of that traffic becomes Wikipedia contributors, increasing our contributor base. The enlarged contributor base then writes another two thousand articles, which Google dutifully spiders, and then we receive an even larger influx of traffic. All the while, no doubt in part due to links to our articles from Google, an increasing number of other websites link to Wikipedia, increasing the standing of Wikipedia pages in Google results. Needless to say, we're delighted to be in this situation.

All right, so far, I've explained three distinguishing characteristics of the Wikipedia project--it's a wiki, it's an encyclopedia, and it's open content--and I have said a few things about Wikipedia's growth.  Next, I would like to switch gears a bit, and answer some obvious objections to the very idea of Wikipedia.  There is, in fact, a very long page on Wikipedia that you can read in which I and some other people have posed and answered a whole raft of criticisms of Wikipedia.

In academia, we learn, one way or another, that the reputation of an author is very important for determining credibility, and reputation is determined to a great extent by such things as faculty appointments and by publications.  Given that, how can we respect the credibility of a project to which any anonymous user can drop any string of characters onto a Wikipedia page?  There are a lot of other, closely related objections.  If anyone can contribute, how do we know that what we're reading hasn't been written by a crank, a mediocre student, or someone with an ax to grind?  The project has no peer review process, or at least no traditional review process--so how can we trust the content generally?

The short answer to most of such objections is that we are constantly editing each others' work via the same process that makes easy article creation possible in the first place--and this turns out to be a reasonably powerful, though far from perfect, review process in itself.  Moreover, as I'll explain in a moment, Wikipedia remains loosely associated with Nupedia, which has a more traditional academic review process.

Now to expand this short answer.  The general objection can be formulated as an argument (in the form of a hypothetical syllogism), as follows:

Premise 1.  If Wikipedia is open to anyone to edit, then it permits contributions by cranks, vandals, dilettantes, and other unreliable sources.

Premise 2.  If Wikipedia permits contributions by the aforementioned unreliable sources, then it is itself an unreliable reference.

Conclusion.  Therefore, if Wikipedia is open to anyone to edit, then it is an unreliable reference.

Now, the first premise here is true (in fact, the logicians will be happy to point out that it's logically true).  Indeed, if Wikipedia is open to anyone to edit, then it does permit contributions by all sorts of riff-raff.  It's the second premise that those familiar with the project will deny.  Just because we do permit cranks, vandals, etc., to contribute, it hardly follows just from that that Wikipedia is unreliable.  What if, as is the case, we have a lot of reliable regulars who are constantly monitoring the &quot;Recent Changes&quot; page, and cleaning up after the riff-raff, and constantly editing everyone else's work as well, for that matter?  If a crank contributes some crankish article on a pet theory only to find it nearly instantly deleted, or edited beyond recognition, then the crank is going to go away in a huff.  We've seen this happen a number of times already.  As for vandals, if some kid with too much time on his hands types in obscenities on a page, it's easy enough for someone to restore the last unvandalized version of the page; and if necessary, I personally ban the vandal's IP address from working on the project.

My point here is that it is hardly as though Wikipedia were simply--no more than--a repository of nonsense and drivel, because it certainly is not that, and the reason for that is that Wikipedians keep a watchful eye over new contributions.  I am not trying to persuade you that Wikipedia produces work that can, at present anyway, match the reliability of a traditional encyclopedia.  But over time, articles improve considerably, and a number of our articles are nearly as good as anything you'll find in any encyclopedia.  That's because the core group of our contributors includes quite a few Ph.D.'s, professors, professionals, and top-flight students.  So I would say that a better way to estimate the reliability of Wikipedia, than simply to say that it permits cranks and vandals to contribute, is to observe that the articles that are now part of Wikipedia have been created by a general public under the general guidance of some very smart, articulate people.  In other words, article quality is determined by standards enforced by the best and brightest of a particular community--not by the worst, most transient elements of that community.

Still, you might ask yourself whether there is any sort of guarantee that the information in any given article is reliable, at least according to someone whom we ought to be able to trust--you know, an expert.  Well, that's a good question, and the answer is: not yet.  But we have discussed various ways of putting someone's stamp of approval on our best articles.  We want to design an approval system that does not interfere with the creation of new content--we don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  Probably the most promising scheme is to combine efforts with Nupedia, letting Wikipedia act solely as a content-generation system and letting Nupedia act as a content-approval system.  One thing that makes me a bit optimistic about this is that we are in the process of designing a greatly-simplified, but still traditional academic, review system for Nupedia articles.  In essence, the process of getting an article accepted to Nupedia will be very similar to the process of getting an article accepted to an academic journal: an expert reviewer will simply read the article and say &quot;yea,&quot; &quot;nay,&quot; or &quot;conditional pass.&quot;  This should be a great improvement over Nupedia's present system, which, frankly, has ground to a halt under the weight of its baroque and extremely rigorous review system, after having produced twenty-five articles.  (Twenty-five excellent articles, mind you.)  We think the new Nupedia system will, for a variety of reasons, be much more productive, and some of us think it might prove to be a suitable review mechanism for Wikipedia articles.

There's one more very important aspect of Wikipedia that I think needs to be introduced, and that is that Wikipedia projects in other languages are being developed concurrently with the English language project.  Currently, some of the largest and most well-trafficked projects, aside from the English language project, are those in Polish, Spanish, and German, but you might be interested to know that the Esperanto project has been taking off as well; and content has been added to other Wikipedias as well.

Unfortunately, it's difficult for me to manage these other projects because, while I know a little German and even less French and Russian, I don't enough of any of these languages to be able to be taken seriously as a sort of project leader.  So, while Wikipedia.com hosts these websites, for the most part they have been developing entirely on their own.  We have set up a mailing list for cross-language Wikipedia discussion, though, and that provides the community a very weak oversight function.

There's an issue about the international Wikipedia situation that you might find interesting--I certainly do, anyway.  The issue is how, and to what extent, work done by these different wikis should be coordinated.  For example, should we, the organizers of the project as a whole, try to dictate to people who are working on the French language wiki project that articles in French should, wherever possible, be translations of any existing English language articles?  Well, we think that such an attempt would be clearly anti-wiki--which, in case you didn't know, is a bad thing.  Basically, the reason that wikis work as well as they do is that people feel free to add content to them.  Now, in organizing the English language Wikipedia project, I think we've discovered that a wiki can be guided to satisfy certain basic policy constraints.  So it's not just nonsensical to suggest that we might ask people who are writing in other languages to translate a longer, English language article on a subject, if such an article exists in English.  We could ask people working on the French language wiki, for example, to do that; the problem is that, probably, no one would want to work on the French language wiki in that case.

So, instead, with the newest version of the software that runs Wikipedia, we're going to make it very easy for people to set up links between articles in different languages.  This, I think, you might find to be an interesting technical puzzle.  If we write an article titled, say, &quot;philosophy&quot; for the English language Wikipedia, and the Germans have written a different article, titled &quot;philosophie,&quot; for the German language Wikipedia, we need a nice easy way to link those two articles.  Then, if someone writes an article about philosophy in Polish, the software should allow us simply to link the article to either the English or the German language article, and all of the articles about philosophy will be interlinked automatically.

In this way, while we won't have any official requirement that people translate articles from one language into another, we can adjust the articles in different languages to each other.  Hopefully in the long run, all of the articles will have a maximal amount of useful information about all of their topics, in all languages spoken on the Internet.  The dream is that we can get to that point not by establishing a single lingua franca like English, but by allowing articles in all different languages to converge naturally (as it were) through interlinking.

== Why Wikipedia matters. ==

So far in this talk I've simply tried to introduce you to the Wikipedia project.  In the second, briefer part of the talk, I'm going to explain why, at least in my opinion, Wikipedia matters--or how it could matter after some more development, if it is properly guided.  I'm going to try to persuade you that it is, or could become, an important project on multiple levels.

There's a lot that I could say under this heading, but I'm going to have to restrain myself.  The fact is that, right now, like most websites and like most open source and open content projects, Wikipedia just isn't very important, not in the grand scheme of things anyway, and it would be rather silly of me to try to convince you otherwise.  So I'm going to try to limit my remarks to the more demonstrable and plausible of the points that I could make.

&lt;b&gt;Importance as an encyclopedia&lt;/b&gt;

Wikipedia is of growing importance as an encyclopedia, primarily because it is a free encyclopedia.  If we were where we are now and it were 1999, when Britannica and other encyclopedias online were free of charge, this would be harder to maintain.  But as things are, as surprising as this might sound, Wikipedia is rapidly becoming one of the better free reference works online.

Moreover, Wikipedia's freedom will grow only more important as our content grows in breadth, depth, and quality.  If there comes a time when it is beyond any doubt that, in terms of breadth, depth, and quality, Wikipedia is comparable to some given proprietary encyclopedia, that encyclopedia might have a difficult time staying in business.  And if, as is possible but by no means certain, Wikipedia and Nupedia together develop to become a really great encyclopedia, one has to wonder what will become of the proprietary encyclopedias like Britannica and Encarta.  Of course, those proprietary encyclopedias have nothing to worry about right now.  For all we know, maybe no open content encyclopedia will ever develop into anything that can compete with Britannica, for reasons that we can see now only murkily.  But if they have anything to worry about, it is the fact, as I explained earlier, that, since it is open content, Wikipedia is quite naturally an institution--meaning that we have the advantage of time.

One might very well consider Wikipedia and Nupedia together to be important as the first example of a usable encyclopedia that is built collaboratively by the public.  Some maintain the Web itself is, for all intents and purposes, a giant encyclopedia built of course by the public (who else?).  So if you consider the Web as an encyclopedia, then of course Wikipedia is, as just a very small part of the Web, not at all significant as an example of a publicly-built reference source.  Even conceding that, though--which on semantic grounds one might not want to--Wikipedia would be our first example of a useable encyclopedia built by direct collaboration among members of the public, an international public.

&lt;b&gt;Importance as an online, collaborative project&lt;/b&gt;

Another area in which one might well think that Wikipedia is of importance is as an online, collaborative project.  I say this because it tests and demonstrates the viability of completely wide-open, collaborative writing, made possible only by the Internet, and implemented perhaps for the first time by wiki software.  The Web is of course an amazing medium, permitting the extremely rapid propagation of and interlinking between documents, and thereby providing a lot of new ways to learn, discuss, and collaborate.  In my opinion--though this thought is of course not original to me--the wiki concept represents a leap forward in how the web can work.  It allows total strangers from around the world to collaborate on the creation of content in ways that, prior to Wiki, were virtually unknown, even on the Internet.  The closest thing to it was the collaboration people often did on Usenet FAQs.  But that's a poor analogy, because there was always an FAQ maintainer.  On wiki, there is no &quot;wiki maintainer.&quot;  This is one of the main reasons that I am not the editor-in-chief of Wikipedia.  The whole idea of an editor-in-chief, of the ultimate responsibility of a text resting with some one person or small group of people, is contrary to the way that wikis can and should work.

Now, to be clear, what makes Wikipedia important in this context is that it provides one of the very best examples, in my opinion, of the success of the wiki concept.  Of course, it's a new wiki--it's far from being the first.  Moreover, there have been other useful wikis, of course.  But those older wikis have been mainly of interest and of use to computer programmers; being an encyclopedia, Wikipedia has a much broader appeal.  I think Wikipedia has proven and will continue to prove to the general online public, in a way that the other wikis could not, that online collaborative writing in a radically open context is a viable option.  I think that as Wikipedia becomes better known and as it grows, it will be pointed to as an example of how and why open, collaborative writing can produce useful content.

To put it simply, Wikipedia demonstrates particularly clearly how people can collaborate and talk to one another in a new way online.

&lt;b&gt;Importance as an open content/free resource&lt;/b&gt;

My final point can be made briefly.

I think Wikipedia is important in that it can be held up as one of the best examples of an open content project, or a free content project (&quot;free&quot; being used here in the GNU sense).  Indeed, Wikipedia and Nupedia are frequently cited in online discussions as among the most important examples of open content projects.  Of course, there are a number of books and articles that have been released under an open content license, which you can read, for example, at Andamooka.org; but very many of those books are, again, aimed at programmers.  Like the Internet as a whole, both wiki and the open content concept have started out being of interest mainly to programmers; but, if it succeeds rather better than it has done so far, I think Wikipedia will help to make the wiki concept and the open content concept popular among a much broader audience.  I think that's a good thing.

Hi Larry, we are translating the talk at the spanish wikipedia. We have several more contributors now, and I think we could reach the 1000 articles in a few months (or maybe weeks). --[[user:AstroNomer|AstroNomer]] 13:58, 12 April 2002

==24==
Hey, Larry. Not wanting to ''feed the trolls'', I'm not responding to any of 24's banalities, but I did want to drop a message of support for you, since 24's gotten a bit rude to you  personally (as is, of course, the nature of trolls and kooks both).  My private hypothesis is that (a) he envies the respect you have here, and (b) he wants to &quot;lead&quot; Wikipedia and turn it to his own visions, and is upset because you've been much more of a leader and your vision (and Jimbo's) are the driving force of Wikipedia. :)   [[user:-- April|-- April]]  14:53, 12 April 2002 
*Thanks, April!  I agree with your analysis; I just posted something on the subject of trolls and trolling (though not with any special application to 24) on Wikipedia-L. --[[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]
:Larry, you have my support to revert any changes and delete any new pages that 24 makes.  --[[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]] 14:14, 13 April 2002
:*Hi Chuck, and thanks.  But please don't wait for me to do it, because I was just thinking that after this most recent Wikipedia-L post, I was done doing all the damage control I had planned on doing.  I have to get back to doing what I was doing in my life outside Wikipedia.  :-) --[[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] 22:49, 13 April 2002 
::Life outside Wikipedia... what's that?  Oh yeah...  j/k  :-)  --[[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]] 22:49, 13 April 2002 
::*Notwithstanding the groupie-like adoration of the above, which does much to discredit Sanger's views and motivations, Larry Sanger's contribution to the meta site is important enough to warrant a link to his writing being on the main page.  I do not support the wholesale removal of everything that he wrote from that page - even if it's obsolete now. [[User:142.177.103.230]] 04:31, 15 February 2003
:Is this what passes for &quot;analysis&quot; in this &quot;community&quot;? Hm. Yes you should know what a troll is, and what it isn't, but you should have one set of criteria. For instance: if rudeness is the criteria, LeeDanielCrocker and AxelBoldt and Zundark certainly fail it often enough. Jimbo on the other hand is rarely rude, and it pays off in the respect that people give him. 24 [[User:24.150.61.xxx]] 19:09, 12 April 2002
*I'm not upset, although yes I've been rude in response to extreme rudeness and patronizing claims, and I have no issue with Jimbo other than the claim of &quot;community&quot;. As an &quot;it&quot;, I can't and won't &quot;lead&quot; wikipedia anywhere, and if it turns to any [[visions]] they will be those of the user base itself - to which I encourage you to contribute, especially if they contradict mine - which I revealed specifically so that you could, unlike your agenda which you seek to hide I think. Your assumptions of envy or power lust are your own, they are not mine. My paradigm rejects the idea that driving visions should come from the leaders. 24 [[User:24.150.61.xxx]] 23:19, 12 April 2002

==Genoa==
Hi, my nick-name is Ettorre, but my name is Gregorio, lives in Genoa and I would be very happy as all the Italian wikipedians if you came to the meeting in Genoa. It forgives my English, but I am not a god in to speak it. [[User:151.38.231.25]] 00:03, 23 February 2004

==Subpages==
Hi Larry, I very much enjoyed your columns on subpages. I find it very interesting that Google made the same decision regarding the use of folders for email that wikipidians have made for sub-pages and using topics and sub-topics. Basically I think there is great wisdom in including everything at the general level (unless the use of subpages is needed to control the organization of a topic [like your example of poker]) and then allow labels and searching and linking to identify the relationships between things. This allows the comptuer to do what it does best - sort and manage large volumes of information - so that we don't have to.  Google does the same thing by allowing you to label emails for organization puproses but does not limit you to that organization - unlike outlook where if I drop an email into the wrong folder I have trouble finding it later, or if I forget to label (opps - drop it into a folder) I have to search my archive. 

Just wondering if you had made the connection between having all articles be on equal footing and Google's treatment of email similarly - there are similar comparisons for their delete or archive paradigm and the [[Candidates for speedy deletion]] etc. - Jim [[User:Trodel]] 16:13, 5 November 2004 

==NPOV Draft==
Hi Larry, I would like to begin making suggestions for your updated draft, but was unsure how you would prefer them done. I will assume on the discussion page, but let me know if you have a different preference. Additionally, I really like the idea. I hope only to add some precision to a great idea. [[User:Dmarney|Dmarney]] 06:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

by [[maveric149]]&lt;br /&gt; 
Biology 173&lt;br /&gt;
 
In 1883 Sir Thomas Huxley stated during the International Fisheries Exhibition in London, that &quot;all the great sea-fisheries are inexhaustible.&quot; Unfortunately, this has been the primary assumption of most fisheries throughout world history. In fact, the very ability for the Earth to support human life in the future is in danger. The activities of humans are producing harmful changes to the conditions that support life on Earth. One of the greatest challenges that faces humanity, is the wanton destruction of the worlds fisheries. In fact, worldwide, the average person obtains 16 percent of his or her daily animal protein from fish. And unless this and other similar adverse activities are changed, human life will increasingly be miserable for an increasing portion of humanity. 

The multitude of threats that are faced by the worlds fisheries are ?caused by patterns of human behavior, particularly over-population and over-consumption.? Alarmingly, the number of overexploited marine fish species has increased from nearly 0% in 1950 to 35% in 1996. Added to this figure is an additional 25% that are near full exploitation. Indeed, many fish species are unable to quickly bounce back after a major population crash ? as has been seen in the cod fishery of the Grand Banks. 

In addition to the direct food and materials we harvest from the sea, there are many other so-called ?ecosystem services' derived from the oceans. The marine environment produces oxygen, assists in nutrient recycling, storm protection and climate regulation. For example, the Gulf Coast of the United States lies along five states, which include Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The Gulf Coast is one of the United States' biggest ecosystems and is linked to a sizable part of the nation's economy. In this region, tourism, fisheries, agriculture, and energy resources are the most important parts of the economy. Five of the top ten fishing ports in the US are located here, and the multitude of commercial fisheries within this area produce approximately 2 billion tons of fish, shrimps, oysters, and crabs on a yearly basis. Many natural resources are required to fuel these important parts of the Gulf Coast economy. 
However, there are many ways that humans can harm the ocean environment that we depend upon. Some of these ways include the destruction of mangroves for shrimp farms, mining coral reefs for building material, the devastation of benthic habitat by trawls, the capture of non-targeted species and the use of dynamite and cyanide to collect shallow-water fish. But, in the case of the Gulf Coast, increasing human populations in the cities that lie along the coast, along with growing demand for the natural resources that the Gulf Coast offers, are to blame for much of its decline. 

On top of these critical issues, however, is that fact that decades of overexploitation, environmental abuse, and mismanagement, have degraded the ability of Gulf Coast ecosystems to cope with the increasing demand of ever-larger human populations. Both natural and human-caused climate change has also affected the economy and by extension, the quality of life for the many millions of people who live in this area. What has resulted from this situation is increasing degrees of damage and even the outright destruction of the ecological systems that sustain the natural resources of the Gulf (namely, fisheries). 

Furthermore, following the massive flooding of the Mississippi River in 1993, the ?hypoxic (or low-oxygen) &quot;dead zone&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico more than doubled its size?. Now over 7,700 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico cannot sustain large fish species ? there simply is not enough oxygen in the water to support higher forms of life. The reason why this has occurred has been attributed by scientists to be from agricultural derived nutrient runoff from the Mississippi River basin. The way in which this occurs is as follows: During the warmer months of summer and early fall, the agriculturally derived nutrients cause eutrophication which causes high amounts of organic production, that in turn causes huge algal blooms. However, this surge in production goes a bit overboard, and when the algae decompose, oxygen breathing bacteria consume much of the algae and nearly all of the available dissolved oxygen. Scientists refer to the result as hypoxia (literally, ?hypo' meaning low, and ?oxia' referring to oxygen). Unfortunately, reports of hypoxic zones from around the world have been steadily on the rise since the mid '60s. 

Both eutrophication and the resulting hypoxia have caused increased mortality of substrate or benthic life forms in a multitude of marine ecosystems and have therefore stressed fisheries all over the world. In fact, some algal blooms are so noxious that they can change the way in which coastal ecosystems function and even threaten the health of human beings. Of course ?Anthropogenic nutrient loading from sources such as agriculture, fossil fuel emissions, and climate events are believed to be related to the global increase in frequency, size, and duration of certain algal blooms.? 

Unfortunately, history has shown us that the economic foundation, which underlies fisheries, has continually led to us to overexploitation of fish stocks and the eventual decline of the fishery. Furthermore, there has been very little attention given to the way in which multispecies interactions occur within a fishery. This lack of understanding of fishery ecology is the primary reasons why regulations that are drafted by national and international organizations continue to fail to protect fisheries. 

?Fisheries make the largest single anthropogenic impact on the ocean environment.? Pollution cannot equal the subtraction of approximately 100 million tones biomass from the oceans on a yearly basis. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a systematic study on how the yearly fish harvest affects the ecology of the world's oceans (even though there are many examples of dramatic effects such as; changes in fish morphology, shifts in mammal populations seen in the Antarctic, and odd periodic occurrences of large jellyfish swarms? etc). One of the biggest problems is that fishing companies are simply not subject to the same stringent standards as terrestrial companies that harvest equivalent amounts of biomass. 

After the collapse of a number of key fisheries around the world by the 1970's, there was an effort to try different fisheries management strategies. For example, statistical analysis was used to show that changes in climate appeared to cause fluctuations in the population cycles of some fish stocks. Unfortunately, the resolution of the models used at that time, could not tell what the underlying factors were that caused the changes. However, in spite of their shortcomings, these early statistically based studies have shown the need for changes in the way in which fisheries science is conducted. Hopefully in the future we will be able to more accurately be able to predict what is actually happening in fisheries. We owe this to ourselves, to the 3 billion more people that will have to be fed in the next 50 years and also to the ecological systems themselves. The oceans have sustained us well in the past, we need to be responsible stewards to make sure they will continue to do so in the future.

'''The last substantial edit to this page was made on or before [[5 Februrary]] [[2002]] and as such this page contains numerous inaccuracies'''.

Over the last year, we have had many discussions about the various ways
foreign characters are used, and I think we reached consensus on many of
the issues, but those discussions are a bit scattered.  I think a simple,
organized, documented policy on these issues is important to help all the
newcomers, and also to serve as a spec for fixing the new software to
properly support and enforce those choices.

The following applies only to the &quot;primary&quot; English language Wikipedia.
Foreign Wikipedias will probably use different character encodings and
allow foreign characters in titles.

== Article Titles ==

[[Help:Page name|Article title]]s will be composed of a string of characters from among the
set of upper- and lowercase US [[w:ASCII]] (7 bit) letters, digits, hyphen, comma,
period, left and right parenthesis, apostrophe, forward slash, and space.
Article titles will be converted to &quot;canonical&quot; form by the software, which
will consist of collapsing strings of spaces into a single space, removing
any spaces at the beginning or end of a title, and capitalizing the first
letter of the title and any letter that appears after a space, hyphen, comma,
period, parenthesis, or forward slash (but not after an apostrophe).
The software should prevent the creation of articles whose titles contain
illegal characters.

Article titles should be English terms.
Foreign names and words that have Anglicized forms in common use
(for example, &quot;Taoism&quot;, &quot;Venice&quot;) should use that name to facilitate
cross-referencing other works that are likely to use that name.
Otherwise, the title should use a simplified transliteration
of the native term.
The Anglicized title is a convenience for searching and indexing,
and does not necessarily have to be a usable English term if none
exists that matches the above rules (for example, an article about
&quot;El Niño&quot; can be titled &quot;El Nino&quot; even though the tilde is universally
included even in English news reports.)

Spanish and French terms can simply omit diacriticals in the title.
German terms can translate &quot;&amp;ouml;&quot; to &quot;oe&quot;, &quot;&amp;szlig;&quot; to &quot;ss&quot;, etc.
Chinese terms can use Pinyin without tonal markings.

== Article Content ==

The first paragraph of an article with an Anglicized title (and preferably
the first sentence) should spell out the proper foreign name, using
foreign characters if necessary, and should also include any other
transliterations or alternate names in common use (perhaps parenthetically).
This is also were the full names of persons commonly known by nicknames
or pseudonyms should appear (the article should be titled by the most
commonly known form).
Any other names by which something might be searched for should also
be mentioned; for example, historical names of cities that have
changed political affiliation.

Article content is edited, stored, and served in the [[w:ISO 8859-1]] encoding.
Characters within that set may be either encoded directly or as [[w:HTML]]
named entity references.
The majority of text in most articles should use the subset of ISO
characters recommended on the [[w:Wiki special characters]] page that will
work in almost all systems.
The bulk of an article about a foreign subject should use the name
of that subject as it would most commonly appear in contemporary
English-language texts about the subject, which will usually--but
not always--be the same as the article title (for example, English
texts usually do include most simple European diacriticals, so the
&quot;Kurt Goedel&quot; article can use &quot;G&amp;ouml;del&quot; in the body of the text).

Characters outside this range may be encoded as HTML numeric entity
references from the ISO 10646 ([[w:Unicode]]) character set.
The content of an article should never depend upon such characters
being properly rendered, but should use them only for additional
information.
For example, articles on Chinese people and places may include the
Han ideographs purely for additional interest, but should use the
Anglicized name throughout the article itself.

Math symbols defined as named HTML entities in the
[http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/ HTML 4.01] specification
can be used in math articles if needed.
If it is possible to avoid using them or to use ASCII substitutes without
overly burdening the article with awkward text, then it is preferred
to do so.
For example, an article that only briefly mentions a transfinite
such as Aleph-null should just spell that out; but an article on
transfinites themselves that has multiple equations might reasonably
require the Aleph symbol.

The following punctuation marks, which are recognized by a majority of
web browsers even though they are outside the ISO set, are allowed but
not encouraged, and may be included as as HTML entity references with
the following names: copy, reg, bull, euro, lsquo, rsquo, ldquo, rdquo,
mdash, ndash.

Other &quot;specialty&quot; Unicode symbols that help make an article clearer may
be used, but only sparingly and in such a way that the article is still
understandable to readers whose system cannot render them.

If article titles can only contain a subset of ASCII, it would be nice to be able to change what is displayed at the top of the page, by some kind of #TITLE line or a separate field on the edit page, so that the page on [[w:El Nino|El Nino]] can actually say '''El Niño''' in the header.

:What's wrong with titling an article, e.g. [[El Niño]] and making e.g. [[El Nino]] a #redirect to it? Latin-1 titles need to work for the [http://fr.wikipedia.com/ French], [http://de.wikipedia.com/ German], etc Wikipedias, so there's no technical reason why they won't work. (Well, they're broken right *now* but that's a bug due to certain URLs not being URL-escaped, and should be fixed shortly.) Certainly there's no reason to limit ourselves to ASCII when the customary spelling of a name or word *in English* uses non-ASCII Latin-1 characters, and the typing/searching argument is easily taken care of by redirects, just like other common misspellings. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 2002/02/06

::The primary reason for limiting titles to ASCII is that most English-speaking Internet users don't know how to enter non-ASCII characters on their keyboards, and so will have difficulty searching for articles, guessing URLs, and creating new links.  Those of us who do know how can always edit the article text to be nicer, but keeping the titles simpler is a big win for simplicity.  Redirects help the search problem a bit, but only if authors remember to do them.  It is critically important that creating a useful new article be easy.

(I happen to personally believe that Unicode isn't being given enough chances and that there's nothing wrong with storing the header as UTF-8, converted from Latin-1 and entities by something like &lt;code&gt;recode_string('h..utf8', $title)&lt;/code&gt;.)

:This is certainly doable, if so desired. Or, we could just convert the whole wikipedia to UTF-8. :) [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

'''UCS-2''' is an encoding of ISO/IEC 10646, not a character set.
The equivalent in Unicode is '''UTF-16'''.
UTF-16 can encode all Unicode characters, it's just that those not in the Basic Multilingual Plane need to be encoded as surrogates pairs.
Do you want to say that only characters from the BMP should be used, or do you actually mean ''any'' Unicode 3.1 (soon 3.2) characters?

--[[w:Carey Evans|Carey Evans]] 

-----
Yes, what I mean to say is that the underlying character set of Wikipedia, independent of how it is encoded or served, is 16-bit ISO 10646.  Strictly speaking, &quot;UCS-2&quot; is an encoding, but it can only encode the 16-bit plane, not the 32-bit stuff.  At any rate, this is just to conform to HTML 4.01.  I'll try to clarify that.

Yes, we need something like &quot;#TITLE&quot;, and we've talked about that before a lot.  Something like that probably will happen, and if it does, there will no longer be any compelling reason to avoid special characters in that display-title.  But I ''do'' still think article titles should generally be English terms.  [[user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]

----

We should use [[bignum]]s for character codes (^_^)

Actually, we should just allow diacriticals to be used in a header. What if there ARE two names which are alike but for accent marks? How likely is that? I think we will start getting some of those soon... [[Juuitchan]]

:We ''do'' allow diacritics in titles. However, the English wiki is still limited to what you can squish into Latin-1. --[[user:Brion VIBBER]]</text>

== Who founded Wikiversity? ==

After some research, I have come to the conclusion that you may be the founder or a co-founder of Wikiversity.  Or, if not, you may be able to comment on who you believe is the founder of Wikiversity.  Please respond, and if you could, let me know on my Talk page that you've replied. Thank you so much! -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] 18:48, 22 March 2010 (UTC)
:I was involved in early discussions about starting such a project in 2003 but had little to do with the launch of the beta in 2006. I suggested the name &quot;WikiUniversity&quot; but Stanford Forte suggested that be simplified to &quot;Wikiversity.&quot; I then bought the domain names for Wikiversity and later donated them to the Foundation.

== Need some help getting my (SUL) account on Test Wikipedia unblocked. ==

Hi Mav, I've got an SUL'd account on [http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ginbot86 the Test Wikipedia] that got blocked back in '08 when I left my public workstation without logging out and someone was having some 'fun' at my expense; I never really worried about it for a while but I'm concerned that it would cause problems if I try to add an RfA in the future. I couldn't request an unblock there because the admin who blocked me there prevented me from accessing my talkpage. Any feedback is appreciated.

I'm most active on the English Wikipedia; if you want to discuss this there, leave a message on my [[:en:User talk:Ginbot86|English Wikipedia talk page.]] Thanks! &lt;small&gt;[[User:Ginbot86|GB]]&lt;/small&gt;[[User talk:Ginbot86|86]] 04:45, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

Greetings! You recently granted admin rights at Russian Wikinews. I am the other admin there. We've got bot status request that we can't fulfil without a steward.

== Your comment at tpi.wikipedia's Haus Bilong Toktok ==

Hi Mav. Thanks for extending my temporary administrative status at tpi.wikipedia - I notice you added a comment saying that I should consider permanent administrative status next time, in other words, I assume you want me to apply through the local process at tpi.wikipedia.  The problem we have is that even now, tpi.wikipedia doesn't get enough attention from local users to make a local RfA feasible.  I'd say a good 70 to 80% of all edits there are either bots or stewards.  I hope you will understand that until we're active enough to use the local RfA process again, I'll need to keep applying through the Stewards.  Hopefully we'll be lively enough soon to make the site swing :)  [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] 18:09, 24 July 2010 (UTC)
:That's fine. If I process your request next time and it is still for temp access, I'll extend it for year. --mav

== Deletion of [[b:eo:Ŝablono:Forigu/dokumentado]] ==

Hello. I am not sure why you have deleted that page (you haven't changed the summary). It is the documentation subpage of the deletion template, and you have no Esperanto edits, so I guess it may have been a mistake. --[[User:AVRS|AVRS]] 19:21, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

== Fundraising Committee ==

Hi there!  Thanks for volunteering to sit on the Fundraising committee.  The work of the committee will be really valuable to making this year's annual giving campaign really effective.  I've posted an overview to [[Fundraising 2010]], and would love your thoughts on the talk page.  I'm also going to try to set up an IRC meeting soon, and hope you'll join for that.  Keep an eye [[Fundraising 2010/Committee]] for a couple of proposed times!  Thanks again... [[User:Philippe (WMF)|Philippe (WMF)]] 18:23, 3 August 2010 (UTC)

== Meeting ==

Hi all,

I'd like to have a meeting on IRC this week to discuss the 2010-2011 annual appeal/fundraiser.  This will be an &quot;anyone is welcome&quot; type meeting, open to the broad community.  During this, Zack Exley and I will take you through our inital thoughts about the fundraiser and its organization, and ask you to join us in a discussion about the (massive) role of volunteers and chapters in this year's fundraiser.

Because of the vagaries of time zones, scheduling live meetings is hard.  So, we'll have a couple of potential times, and we'll log and post the meeting for anyone who wasn't able to make it.

The meetings will be held Thursday, 12 August at 23:00 UTC (16:00 PDT) and Friday, 13 August at 16:30 UTC (09:30 PDT) in the #wikimedia-fundraising channel on the freenode network on IRC (irc://irc.freenode.net/wikimedia-fundraising).  You can access this using freenode's webclient, which is available at http://webchat.freenode.net/ or by using your favorite IRC client.

Hope to see you there! [[User:Philippe (WMF)|Philippe (WMF)]] 20:32, 10 August 2010 (UTC)

== Fundraising 2010 ==

Hello Daniel,
thanks for showing interest in the fundraising committee.  You can see that we've started to develop the [[Fundraising 2010/Committee|Committee structure]] and I'd like to encourage your thoughts and participation in the formulation of the important role Wikimedians will play in our drive this year.  Please leave me a message if you have a specific request from me, otherwise head to the talk pages and lets get started brainstorming!

My Steward, if it is possible, I would like to ask you to insert any &quot;style sheet&quot; in or in respect of the Thai Wikisource for the tables therein are all colourless and have no lines at all. Certain users said it is so required. Thank you so much. --[[User:Aristitleism|Aristitleism]]

== Advice needed about accounts ==

I think I have screwed up a bit by taking the wrong route. Recently I made the account &quot;Night of the Big Wind&quot; (home wiki en-wp) as a replacement for the account &quot;Eddylandzaat&quot;. (Both sul-accounts). I like to merge the old &quot;Eddylandzaat&quot; with the new &quot;Night of the Big Wind&quot;. Due to a block on de nl-wp (home wiki of Eddylandzaat) I can not change the name there.

Can you advice me / help me in solving this? [[User:Night of the Big Wind|Night of the Big Wind]] 13:31, 18 May 2011 (UTC)

== You made the last edit on Wikipedia before it went dark. ==

Right at 05:00, 18 January 2012 (UTC) you made this edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Stop_Online_Piracy_Act&amp;curid=33630829&amp;diff=471995872&amp;oldid=471995648 here] and then Wikipedia went dark to protest the SOPA initiative. If anyone ever trys to imply you not special, refer them to this. [[User:Richard-of-Earth|Richard-of-Earth]] 18:45, 18 January 2012 (UTC)

'''Coordinate Systems'''&lt;br&gt;
*Locations can be shown in absolute or relative terms
*There are relative and absolute locations
* Use earths equator and [[w:prime meridian]] to locate things on the earth
*lat/long is not based on cultural features.
*The location of origin is not important, just the locations fixed using the origin
In order to use a coordinate system...
# Select an origin; usually chosen in the lower left corner of map
# Any point on map can be then specified  

gap in notes


Lat/long coorinates can be specified is different formats:
# DD.MM.SSXX (degre, minute, decimal second)
# DD.MMXX
# DDXX(XX...) = Decimal degree
Most [[w:GIS]] systems need input of lat/long in decimal degrees
* To convert #1 to decimal degrees multiply minutes by 1'/60, multiply seconds by 1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;/60. Then add the two.  
* To convert from decimal degrees to #1, multiply the decimal portion of the location by 60', then multiply the decimal portion of that by 60''. Your answer sould be in DD.MM.SSXX. 

== UTM ==
UTM was created in order to reduce the inherent distortion in [[w:geographic]] [[w:projection]]s. It is based on a [[w:transverse]] [[w:Mercator projection]]. With the earth &quot;wrapped&quot; in a cyllindar and the [[w:tangent]] line touching one of 60 transverse Mercator projections. 
* Used 

gap in notes

* UTM stretches from pole to pole (up to 84N and 80S)
* Each zone is 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; wide (60 zones).
* UTM zone 1 starts at the [[w:International Date Line]]
* Goes counterclockwise around the globe (looking down from the N Pole)
* 

gap in notes

=== Using UTM ===
* Transverse line is centered in the middle of each zone.
* the only place true North and grid north exactly correspnd is at the central meridian of the UTM zone. 
* UTM coordinates are specified as eith eastings (x) and northings (y)
* equator is the y in the northern hem. In the southern hemisphere the South Pole is the y coordinate origin. The max meters of a northing in 10 million (half of the 20 million meters pole to pole)
A false origin is est. for x coordinates west of western limit (alows overlap of zones for military applications)
* All eastings therefore can be given as positive numbers.  
* Central meridian is given the value of 500,000 meters easting.  
* Anything west of the UTM central meridian (&lt;500,000 meters easting) has a grid north that is west of True North. It therefore has a [[w:declination]] a certain number of degrees west. Same for east.

=== Military Grid Coordinate System ===
* based on UTM
* 

gap in notes

=== State Plane Coordinate System ===
Used in US in most every states since 1930's by surveyors for property boundaries and engineering projects.
* Developed to used as a local reference system.
* based on NAD27 (now NAD83) with coordinates in feet (even though NAD83 is in meters).

'''Cylindrical Equal Area projection'''
:Characteristics: straight meridians and parallels (meridians equally spaced, parallels unequal. Scale along central line is distortion-free. Uses cylindrical shape. Shape &amp;amp; scale distortions increase near points 90 degrees from central line. Other examples; Behrmann cylindrical Equal Area, gall's Stereographic Cylindrical, Peters Cylindrical.&lt;br&gt;
'''Azimuthal Equidistant projection''' 
:Characteristics: Used to show air-route distances. Distortion-free at Azimuthal point (which is the central point on the map). Distortion increases as you move away from central point. Other examples of Azimuthal projections; Lambert Equal Area, Oblique Aspect Orthographic, North Pole Stereographic&lt;br&gt;
'''Albers Equal Area Conic projection''' 
:Characteristics: Distorts scale/distance everywhere except along standard parallels, Used for large nations that extend more in east / west directions than North / South. Distortion-free at standard [[meridian]]s. Anything off of standard meridian is distorted. Examples of other Conic projections are; Equidistant, Lambert Conformal, and Polyconic.

'''Longitudinal range of UTM zone 23'''&lt;br&gt;
''Equation to find Western Boundary''
:180-[(''n''-1) x 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
Equation with 23 for ''n''

''Equation to find Eastern Boundary''
:180-(''n'' x 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
Equation with 23 for ''n''
:180-[(''23''-1) x 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;] = 42&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
''Range is therefore:''
:42&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; West to 48&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; West
'''UTM Zone Questions'''&lt;br&gt;
Number of [[w:meter]]s wide for any UTM Zone at the equator (at the equator, every degree [[w:longitude]] is 111.11 kilometers) 
:111.1 kilometers/degree x 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 666.666 kilometers
:666.666 km x 1000 m/km = 666,666 meters
Point on UTM Zone with easting of 400,000 meters. Grid declination is what? 
:West
Point on UTM Zone with easting of 560,000 meters. Grid declination is what? 
:East
'''NAD27 &amp;amp; 83 Questions'''&lt;br&gt;
Use of quad map to measure the difference between [[w:NAD27]] and [[w:NAD83]] projections. How do you find the amount of shifting between these two? 
:In lower left corner of map states that the shift is shown by dashed corner ticks. You measure the shift with a ruler, and use the scale on the map to find the actual distance.
Blue ticks on the map neat lines represent what? 
:1000-meter UTM grid ticks. Noted in lower left corner of map.
Which UTM zone does 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; west fall?
:180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; - 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' x 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
:''n'' = UTM zone 15

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following message has been superseded by this one: [[My resignation--Larry Sanger]]
----
Dear everyone,

After a lot of thinking and negotiating, I've arrived at an important
decision and it's also important that I convey this decision to you.

For reasons I'll let Jimbo explain if he likes--it had ''nothing'' to do
with my job performance or with any personal animosity--I was placed on
half-time pay in January, and as of February 1, I am no longer a Bomis
employee.  There is no ill-will between Jimbo and I, and I wish him and
Bomis all the best.  This means that any work I do for the 'pedias, for
the near future anyway, I am doing as an unpaid volunteer, the same as the
rest of you.

This means two things.  First, I've got to get a job that will pay the
bills, and second, I'm going to have to reduce my participation in the
project quite a bit (over my pre-January participation).

I want to stress that I am ''not'' simply quitting altogether.  I can't see
abandoning the projects I started--they're too important.  I hate to think
of what might become of the projects if I were to quit altogether.  But
Wikipedia has become ''largely'' self-managing, something I'm tickled pink
about, and Nupedia has been moving so slowly anyway that I don't need to
spend a lot of time managing that.  (Ironically, I might have more time
for Nupedia, now that I'm not a paid employee. :-) )  Moreover, Bomis
might well start selling ads on Wikipedia sometime within the next few
months, and revenue from those ads might make it possible for me to come
back to my old job.  That would be great.  I've liked this job very much,
and I'm willing to do some work to help make it pay for itself.

Now that I'm on the job market, if you want to see my resume, let me know
at lsanger@nupedia.com.  I'm willing to work as a consultant or as an
employee--or, possibly, even as a partner.  I have quite a few ideas for
Internet projects that are potentially profitable and/or extremely
productive and interesting.  Among the cards I have to play are proposals
to big Internet portals, thinktanks, and magazines, to spearhead these
projects, much as I've spearheaded Nupedia and Wikipedia.  If you'd like
to discuss these project ideas confidentially on a serious business level,
please let me know.  Of course, I'm interested in less ambitious ways of
making money, too.  :-)

One last thing.  Please don't use this announcement as an excuse to say,
&quot;Fine, I'm quitting then.&quot;  As you can see, ''I'' am ''not'' quitting, even
though prudence about my employment situation might dictate otherwise.  I
have decided to tough it out and join the ranks of volunteers myself.  If
anything, I hope this will make you even more inspired than ever to help:
&quot;By golly, if Larry doesn't quit even though he's out of a job, and
volunteers his now-limited free time, I will too!&quot;  That's what I hope
you'll think.  Just remember: Wikipedia is going full steam ahead.  We've
got nearly 25,000 articles in just a year!  We're getting ever-increasing
amounts of traffic and we have a very large, fairly competent (in some
cases, brilliant) base of contributors.  I will still be around to answer
questions, offer opinions, and occasionally kick ass over bad articles :-).  As for Nupedia, now that I've finally made this decision, I do plan
sometime in the near future to make that final push to rewriting the
policy guidelines with the recent vote in mind.  Magnus Manske is champing
at the bit to write the code (Nunupedia, he calls it) that will implement
the new Nupedia system.  I do think that once the guidelines and the code
are up and running, Nupedia is going to experience growth of a sort it's
never seen before--one or two orders of magnitude greater.  Once we make
it easier and more automatic to submit Wikipedia articles to the new
Nupedia system, I think things are ''really'' going to take off for Nupedia.

Our forging ahead surely doesn't ''require'' my full-time paid involvement.
It would make it a lot easier and faster if I were still involved in such
a capacity, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary.

So--stay the course!

Best,&lt;br&gt;
Larry

      <text xml:space="preserve">Best wishes to you as you start looking for a new job!  We'll miss seeing you around as much, and thanks so much for all the help you've given to a project.  I'm sure it wouldn't be to where it is today without you.  Thanks, [[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]]

Larry, you must be both a bit sad and proud about leaving Bomis at this point. Sad, because you are no longer paid to do what you obviously love to do so much. And proud that your efforts over the past year have given wikipedia great success -- so much so that a full time paid employee is no longer needed to manage the project. It reminds me of an experience I had nursing a sick rock-dove back to health a year ago. I named him Rocky, and after a few weeks he regained his strength and tenacity. Alas, it was time to set him free. When I did so I felt sorrow over the loss of my feathered friend, but I also felt pride and happiness that due to my efforts, a lovely bird was able to fly away. You have given wikipedia wings Larry. And for that I am most grateful. 

Best regards to you and your family. [[w:wikipedia]]       
----
Frankly, a full-time paid employee ''is'' needed to manage the project.  In fact, my opinion is that ten of them wouldn't be enough.  :-)  And I ''will'' still be around, to be sure! --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]</text>

&lt;b&gt;Why plan?&lt;/b&gt;  Chaos is great, I browse and contribute when and where I please, within the editorial guidelines already drafted and posted by somebody, somewhere.  [[Controversy from unclear or conflicting goals of contributing wikipediasts]]

&lt;b&gt;It is important to plan for success because ....&lt;/b&gt;
  
1.)  When the wikipedia community and knowlege base has millions of users, thousands of contributing editors, and hundreds of professional and amateur wikipediasts ..... how shall we govern/manage our activities and generate revenue to fund various requirements such as bandwidth, processors, disk space, salaries, etc. required to stay competitive with other open/free and commercial competitors?

2.)When others wish to emulate our community and ask us how, it will damage our reputation as the best summarizers of all human knowledge to not know how we manage to collect, verify, summarize and deliver it.

3.)It will assist newcomers in determining whether their personal goals and understanding of the site's intended use of contributions are compatible.  It will only cause needless work, hassle and headache to have people contributing under what they perceive as false pretenses, advertising or claims.  At minimum: effort to delete entries.  Towards the other end of the range legal negotiations, flame wars, bad publicity, etc.  Misunderstanding by novices will be detrimental and we must minimize it to succeed longterm.

4.)Wikipedia must succeed commercially to be able to make and meet committments to [[w:stakeholders]].  This will be true of other large free wiki projects as well since  extensive resources are required to serve as a global focal point for internet users.  Thus defining our methods as we refine them will provide a service back to the larger community which provided some of the initial free capital (php, apache, linux, sourceforge, wiki, perl, etc.) necessary to enable our enterprise.
----------

[[Draft mission statements for various types of organizations]]   Please go here and edit or draft generic mission  statements.   By the way, what do we do or intend to do at wikipedia or as Wikipedians?

From this [[w:Wikipedia_press_release_1]] and the front page I would tend to think our existing working mission statement is something like this:

&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia.com:  The Free Encyclopedia.&lt;/b&gt;

If it is documented online as something else please provide the link here for purposes of  this discussion.   I would propose that we put a mission statement link on the front page to facilitate rapid understanding and preclude erronius assumptions.  [[user:mirwin]]

Old discussion being relocated below:

This page was established to discuss methods of improving the impression of initial users and contributers.  This project must succeed commercially to be able to make and meet committments to contributors, owners and users.  This will be true of other large free wiki projects as well since  extensive resources are required to serve as a global focal point for internet users.

I this it is possible to meet these goals with some effort and creativity.  Whether the discussion here is applicable directly to Wikipedia.com will of course be determined by the owner's best judgement of what is best for this commercial venture.

The discussion could obviously be useful to other communities attempting to establish large free wiki resources or knowledge bases onlines even if the results are not useful to Wikipedia.com.

Please jump in if you feel some articulated organization is useful or critical to the success of large free wiki endeavers on the internet.  [[user:mirwin]]

----

The question is [[governance]] (not &quot;government&quot; which has the power to bash heads but &quot;governance&quot; which is mostly persuasion to work within a consensus).

The simplest possible model is to assess [[visions]] which drive people to come here, the more realistic [[best cases]] they establish as objectives once they are here, and the [[threats]] and [[worst cases]] that drive our risk-aversive behaviors.  If people had to follow a [[status quo]] assessing procedure whenever they had a serious problem with &quot;the management&quot;, they might discover much more about themselves and their difference from the rest of us - without being forced to adopt our views or our [[value systems]]. - 24

:Interesting points!  A potential problem.  I have already detected ridicule aimed at me in the stacks from having the temerity to write up a summary of a personal goal as a possible best case or vision.  This is nothing I need learn further, I have been putting up with all my life as a result of family and community values in the geographical lcoation where I reside.   Hence my interest in distributed communities and large scale projects.  Does the internet enable having one's cake and eating it too?  That is the question I am attempting to answer positively.   Free software communities have managed it, although at a scale smaller and more specialized than required for successful space equipment design, manufacture and marketing. I will participate in your proposed method more as I feel the urge and am willing to put up with abuse from the other &quot;Wikipedians&quot;.  [[user:mirwin]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">I agree with the need for this type of discussion. However, there is already two forums for these types of discussions: One over at www.meta.wikipedia.com and the 
[[Wikipedia-L]]. [[user:maveric149|maveric149]]
-------
Thanks! How about if I maintain and moderate this page
for while in case any others show up?


I will check out the links above and we can put them in at
the top of the page as well.  If the other forums are best and bleed off interest then we can delete these pages and transfer material as appropriate.  [[user:mirwin]]
:Sounds good to me. However, someone else may be a bit bold in editing and move the content before we are ready -- just a heads up. [[user:maveric149|maveric149]]

::Some of the long-term users are rather firm on the desire to see meta-discussion off the main wikipedia (for various good reasons, IMHO).  I would suggest you shift the content to meta.wikipedia.com ASAP (which was set up for just this purpose), and if necessary replace the content on the main wikipedia site with a pointer to the article on meta.  --[[user:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]
-------
Just a few comments for mirwin--general comments to your various contributions to Meta-Wikipedia:
* I believe you have overreacted.  Please--polite questions and discussion are much more effective and beneficial to the community than uninformed speculation and attacks.
* This discussion really would be better conducted on [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Wikipedia-L Wikipedia-L], because you basically need clarification of a number of points about Wikipedia policy (that have been addressed elsewhere for the most part), and for a newcomer like yourself, those points are better addressed in the give-and-take format of discussion.  Please observe that some discussion has already begun on Intlwiki-L; but can I ask you, ''please,'' unlike a few of the participants in those discussions, to frame your questions in the least damaging and insulting way possible?  This sort of thing really can throw a lot of cold water on the project.  As this project's founder, I want to see to it that it continues to ''thrive.''  So it is really important that you not undermine it (unintentionally or not!).
* The notion of ''subscriptions'' has never even once been considered.  It's simply ludicrous.  If you had simply ''asked,'' we could have told you this.
* Another thing you would have learned, simply by asking, is that Jimbo and I have long been discussing making a nonprofit to manage Wikipedia and Nupedia.
* The term is &quot;Wikipedian&quot; (or &quot;Wikipedants&quot; :-) ), not &quot;Wikipediasts.&quot;
* Please see [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/wikipedia:Wikipedia+policy this page] and [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/wikipedia:most+common+Wikipedia+faux+pas this one] for general future reference.  :-)
* Generally, consider the logic of this point: we founded this project.  We personally, over and over again, fostered the very community ethos that makes it thrive.  It is ''ridiculous'' to think that, after doing all this very careful planning and work, we would then shoot ourselves in the foot by doing anything very unpopular with the very community that makes it possible! --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

----
Several of the above pages are, indeed, the result of people failing to understand what Wikipedia is about and what makes it work.  But, well, a lot of it is the result of plain old trollishness, impoliteness, and meanness, among other things.  This is not going to go away, unfortunately; 
:it might go away if you'd read and understand [[WikipediAhimsa]], and then declare that this is to be the standard operating policy here from now on.

new trolls, brats, and mean people are born every day.  Wikipedia's goals ''have'' been clarified, probably ad nauseam; see especially &quot;Wikipedia policy&quot; but also &quot;Welcome, newcomers&quot; and &quot;what Wikipedia is not&quot; among various other policy pages. --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]
:all of which must be failing to do the job, or this stuff wouldn't happen.  Trolls, brats and mean people have purposes, too.  Among other things, to point out when everyone else is dead wrong, and oppose [[w:groupthink]].

----
Like it or not Larry, newcomers bring new ideas and some viable controversy resolution beyond &quot;Larry says ...&quot; is useful for large teams.   If you or others wish this to remain a small project where you are clear majority contributors, owners, stakeholders, whatever then it is my opinion you should be honest about this and not solicit others work under false pretenses. 
:Not only &quot;should&quot; they be honest, such solicitation is a federal crime in the United States where rather draconian laws of copyright and racketeering now seem to apply.  But I don't see that attitude from Jimbo Wales, what I see there is a general [[humanism]] that doesn't want to believe that what a broad consensus of scientists believe in, might well be extraordinarily evil or harmful.  The conflict there is between the &quot;Bush League&quot; censoring anthrax research, and those crying &quot;academic freedom&quot; as the &quot;real safety&quot;.

If our goals are now crystal clear then perhaps we should proceed to conflict resolution procedures.   Warfare in the stacks seems a bit counterproductive to me.  [[user:mirwin]]
:it's childish, at best, but that seems to be what the &quot;no-body party&quot; does - they refuse and marginalize even neutral attempts to discern others' [[visions]] and [[best cases]], so I suggest that we fight them by filling out those files with such a broad spectrum of contradictory possibilities that their claim that &quot;we&quot; are somehow &quot;hijacking&quot; &quot;their&quot; project becomes provably ridiculous, instead of just obviously ridiculous as it is already.

      <sha1>fq20ssz2v5uhc0ljsnq28wc88949yom</sha1>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Some questions originating at the wikipedia FAQ/talk page.

'''Q.  Are the casual dropins from the recent efforts in publicity and recruiting given a misleading impression by the front page?'''  In other words, is any work in progress to adequately  define organizational and business models such that &quot;Wikipedia: The Free Enclycopia&quot; can explain what its precise committment to encyclopedia users and contributers consists of and how it plans to fullfill them?

A.  Maybe it could be better.  The following question, answer and subsequent rant was provided by me, after approximately two weeks of participation.  My initial impression of the site was that it was much more mature than  the development mail archives show it to be.  Therefore I was shocked and angered to find it is a commercial activity linked to another dot.com that has apparently not reached critical mass required to deliver and maintain an online commercial encyclopedia, nupedia.com

----
Initial question

Q. What is to prevent the Wikipedia from vanishing or becoming unfree in the future once the critical mass has been achieved to attract aspiring academics and professionals and multitudes of prosperous users demand fast reliable access that only large server farms with plenty of expensive bandwidth can provide?  [[user:mirwin]]

----

Answer available next day.

:It is my understanding the wiki software is under the [[GNU GPL]] and the copyright of all contributions (no matter how small) is owned by the ''individual'' contributors (albeit all licensed under the [[GNU FDL]] by hitting SUBMIT). So the only way the content of wikipedia can be forked into an unfree version is for every single one of the now ''thousands'' of past and present contributers to agree to a change in the license that covers their work. This of course is not at all likely. I am concerned about the backing up of data, however and would like to know more about that. How about wiki-mirrors? I wonder how many giga-bytes just the current versions of all the articles take up.  --[[maveric149]]

----
rant begins here after a day of browsing mailing lists, information onsite and attempting to locate source code

Thanks maveric,  I found a lot of interesting discussion on the wikipedia-L mailing list archive.  There seemed a lot of interest in preventing use of this &quot;community&quot; content by others without attribution to wikipedia.com which is owned by Bomis which is owned by a couple of project founders.   I use quotes because what true &quot;free&quot; community has owners?  It might be worth forking and setting up a mirror to firmly shake out the licensing issues applicable to a true &lt;b&gt;free wiki&lt;/b&gt; site of human knowledge.   Call it (perhaps) the free as in beer and as in use it as you please as long as your modified version remains free as per the published and agreed to license.org.  Perhaps a shorter name will be more marketable and we can still exploit the brand name recognition of the GPL or Gnu FDL because we intend to make it easy to comply with.

Hmmmm .... I risk classification as a &quot;GNU Hawk&quot; here.

Actually I do not see myself as a GNU Hawk, I find it highly irritating to have been &lt;b&gt;suckered&lt;/b&gt; into contributing under what might be construed as false pretenses.  Then upon digging into the archives finding that this was &lt;b&gt;apparently intentional&lt;/b&gt;.  So now that the local site credibility has been damaged in my perception the natural question to ask before contributing much more and recommending the site to friends and fellow travelers is .... can the site be easily
mirrored and/or forked and are plans afoot to assure future financial stability and availability beyond the control of single commercial entity.   No offense intended to Mr. Jimmy Wales, &lt;b&gt;owner&lt;/b&gt; but fatal car accidents happen every day.  It seems incautious to put the potentially millions of manhours worth of effort which a fairly comprehensive high quality free encyclopedia of human knowledge will take to complete (or even the thousands it will take to get to the critical mass sufficient to interest experts and greater numbers of contributors) at risk; hostage to a single commercial entity's whims and fortunes.

Perhaps this is overreaction.   The source code does not seem to be available at sourceforge, the pointers provided point back to wikipedia and engage an infinite loop back and forth.  Perhaps this is an error.

Perhaps some more browsing will clarify this for me but I have been at it all day around the wikipedia site and the mailing list archives.  At this point I will probably conclude this is a truely free project that could be forked at whim (as long as the GPL and GFDL are complied with) when I manage to get a local test mirror up and running with a current snapshot.   This would prove that the knowledge base and the source code to access it is free and could be propagated should an organization or individual provide the wherewithal to do so.

A bit rantish I suppose.  Keep in mind that the GNU branding and the Free Software Foundation is as strong as it is because they aggressively defend against fraudulent exploitation of the licenses and brand.

Anyway, I go now to cool off by contributing a bit and browsing a bit.   I have already accomplished locally that which I wished to.  In my opinion the site proves the potential of the wiki supporting distributed teams in working and publishing free engineering specifications online.  Clearly we, any engineering teams that take up the challenge, should address the basic organizational and licensing issues up front and publish them clearly if we wish to be growing dynamically by co-opting casual dropins.

end rant
----

''Yes, getting a mirror up and running would be a useful proof of concept. I think many of us would be happy to see that this is feasible. Particularly if you document the steps.'' 62.253.128.xxx
----
I also second that proposal. Set up a mirror.

&lt;b&gt;Planning for Success&lt;/b&gt;

Since wikipedia.com is nearing critical mass and there will soon be lots of traffic and heavy contributor load we will soon be needing lots of computer resources, administrative staff, and bandwidth and of course profits to provide ROI.

What are our current plans for revenue sources?

Some initial thoughts of mine:

&lt;b&gt;Advertisement&lt;/b&gt; ..... yuck! Well I can live with but some people do not like it much.

&lt;b&gt;Book sales commissions.&lt;/b&gt;

Affiliate program with online booksellers such that wikipedia.com gets a commission on click through purchases.

Providing links at the bottom of articles should not be too offensive to most people.   At least IMHO.  At any FreeEngineering wiki's I setup we will certainly be attempting this with useful engineering texts and references.   A lot of people like books for reference and study mode and do not mind paying for them even when available online for free.

&lt;b&gt;Web store&lt;/b&gt;  Consumer merchandise.  All the usual publicity aid profit centers.  Shirts, mugs, patches, hats, etc.  One button access on front page should bother people.

Longer term

&lt;b&gt;CD sales&lt;/b&gt;, entire wikipedia sets, specific subjects or books.

&lt;b&gt;User subscriptions&lt;/b&gt;  Yuck!  I am in the project because free access to educational materials online could accelerate larger goals of the global society I would like to live in.  By donating some time I can help myself and all others with internet access.

&lt;b&gt;Forking and Mirroring&lt;/b&gt;

If the local material is truly free and subscriptions become necessary to commercial success, then a fork may occur.

Perhaps we should pre-emptively setup a non profit organization friendly and sympathetic to Wikipedia's owners and contributors interests before someone else does so.  The  non profit could implement sufficient revenue models to sustain itself and provide free beer services to the public while the commercial Wikipedia could focus on more demanding  revenue sources requiring constant professional attention to maximize profits.

:I think ''forking'' would be a terrible idea -- it is difficult enough to maintain ''one'' version of an article. &quot;Forking&quot; of free software/content should only be considered if there are irreconcilable differences between two or more significantly large groups of contributors to a project on how the project should continue. However, read-only mirrors that get backed-up every so often or even simple backing-up of the wiki software (which is under the [[w:GPL]]) and especially content is a necessity. BTW I know this isn't your intention, but I feel that I need to say something anyway (in case someone else reading this only skimmed what you state above): &lt;font color=blue&gt;Jimbo and his company have every right to make a profit off of wikipedia content.&lt;/font&gt; Of course, he does have to conform to both the [[w:GNU FDL]] and [[w:GNU GPL]] -- both licenses legally preventing anyone from making a non-free version of wikipedia. I'm just worried about some act of god destroying the data or for Bomis to fold without making sure the content of wikipedia is handed over to someone with the spare server space and bandwidth to continue the project. Oh and according to [[Larry Sanger]] a non-profit is being seriously considered as the administrating body of wikipedia. [[user:maveric149|maveric149]]

If a fork occurred then I would expect different user communities to evolve.  As you point bouncing between multiple sites would be difficult and I suspect most people would choose to donate/maintain their work at either the fork (free or commercial) or the original commercial entity, Bomis; but not multiple sights.

As the front page is current setup I think it takes advantage of the public image of the FSF and open/free movements to encourage new user buyin.  If after a weeks of participation new users/contributors/free developers find that they have misunderstood the purpose and intention of the site then there will never be a large group of dissatisfied wikipedians here.

If this mode of operation is intentional to help a commercial entity achieve critical mass then in my view it may be fraudulent exploitation of the applicable licenses.
Even if unintentional it has the potential to damage the prestige of the licenses and should be repaired as quickly as possible.

Sure wikipedia has every right to make a profit.  The terms of the licenses cited as intended to preserve everyone else's right to use the same commons collaboratively created to make a profit providing similar or different services around the open/free content.

I suspect that few new users will be familiar enough with the way wikis operate under these licenses to know that the content may useless to competitors unless the attribution data and revision control information along with previous versions are provided.   Particularly since extensive discussion around related issues are taking place attempting to resolve these issues.

The licenses are intended to help maintain truly free marketplaces, not assist commercial entities in establishing  captive market share.
-------



------
CD one offs

Perhaps for the nearterm there would be a market for burned snapshot image archives at a modest fee to get mirror sites and new developers up and running without massive downloads.

While in my view this data should be available for download online; many potential developers have slow internet access at home and might leap at a starter CD at a modest fee.

Another related thought, we might focus on an initial collection of public domain material and get it complete enough to be commercially attractive long before the entire encyclopedia is complete enough to be commercially viable.

Application of Topology
*point (or nodes) are coded with their ID numbes (coordinates) which refer to 3.6 page 36 (points are separeated so no topology.)
* Lines (or arcs) are connected to two nodes (starting or &quot;from&quot; a node and and ending or &quot;to&quot; node. Figure 3.7 p. 37
*Areas are defined by listing the bounding ars and by specifying the polygons on either side of each arc; Figure 3.8 p. 38

Non-topological vector data
*Takes less time to display than topological files
* ArcView's shapefiles are non-topological files

'''Wild ideas to condsider'''

----
A commercial free book/database. Content of database usefully adds or uses existing content at wikipedia, paper book is sold for profit. Lot of potential synergy. See next idea. 

Perhaps we could define a specific free book or project with near term commercial possibilities with O'Reilly or other publishers and develop it swiftly while working here on filling in pieces of the Encyclopedia. Proceeds to help fund Wikipedia or other foundation to begin defraying expenses.

Reasons I think this might work:
# O'Reilly is highly successful at collaboration with open/free developers.
# We have an excellent start at a large pool of experts and editers.
# A carefully chosen subject could aid our recruiting drive.

After noting that I propose our own new project, not taking over her project, see [[w:user:-- April]]'s Introductory Science Text project for an example of what I am visualizing. Please do not forget to contribute a tidbit or too if the muse speaks .... it is the wiki way. [[User:mirwin]] 

----

'''Meta.Wikipedia's Professional Writing Wiki''' working title, got a snazzy or different one? Please jot it here. Waste not want not.

Consider implementing the features necessary to allow professional authors to work in a derived database which a one button download, upload, synchronize process supports. The author has easy access to FDL research, can make their money on a fixed instantaneous snapshot of the subject, then at the close of the project upload the database for volunteers to merge into the Wikipedia as appropriate.

How does Wikipedia make money? Needs discussion. A method that occurs to me is to provide an information needed request page for these types of projects and a small (fractional, very small, miniscule .... think of star trek's spock eludication of [w:Star Trek/A Piece of the Action] prenegotiated percentage of the '''gross''' sales. Note the gross keeps the publisher honest .... cannot eat our piece with overhead.

Lots of authors around so if the above is practical at all we should implement it before our competitors. Authors of all stripes do a '''lot of research'''. This would also expand our viral commons at an accelerating pace if successful. [[User:mirwin]]

How do you (ie the Wiki-community) propose to deal with the African glottal click, which as far as I know has no &quot;authorised&quot; transliteration, but is fundamental (as I understand it) to several tongues ? [From: Scriptator]

----
Moved here from article:
# The Wade-Giles system is seriously flawed. (One may wonder whether it was intended to be a practical joke to make fun of the Chinese language.)  The B and P sounds are both transliterated to P; the D and T sounds are both transliterated to T; the G and K sounds are both transliterated to K; J and Ch sounds are both transliterated to Ch.
Let me address that briefly.

''The Wade-Giles system is seriously flawed.''
:POV.
''The B and P sounds are both transliterated to P''
:Not so. Pinyin '''B''' is Wade-Giles '''P''', true; but Pinyin '''P''' is not Wade-Giles '''P''' but '''P&amp;#39;'''; the &quot;stupid apostrophe&quot;, as you call it, is necessary. Two different sounds, two different representations.
:And it makes sense when you look at the pronunciation: Pinyin &quot;B&quot; is a ''voiceless'' unaspirated stop, the same as the &quot;P&quot; in the French word &quot;Paris&quot;, so using &quot;P&quot; for that is not flawed IMO. And Pinyin &quot;P&quot; is a voiceless ''aspirated'' stop; using apostrophe for aspiration is also not uncommon. -- [[User:Pne|pne]] 15:35, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

----
I agree with [[User:pne|pne]] here.  Many linguists take the view that the main distinguishing factor between the two sounds &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; (both Pinyin here) is aspiration, not voicing as it is in English.  So, Wade-Giles is actually closer to the linguistic representation for these two sounds [p'] and [p], respectively, where ' adds aspiration.

Also, another point about &quot;stupid apostrophes,&quot; they're actually required in standard Hanyu Pinyin if two sounds might be confused for one.  Case in point: xi'an =&gt; xian.

So, I fail to see how apostrophes are &quot;stupid,&quot; and your point might be better taken in the future if you refrain from generalizations such as this.
-- [[User:Wulong|Wulong]] 21:08, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:From [[Daoism-Taoism Romanization issue]]:
:Due to fundamental differences between Chinese and English [[phonology]], in English neither ''d'' nor ''t'' can be considered adequate phonetic representations for the consonant at the beginning of the word ''Dao''/''Tao'' (in pinyin ''d'' represents the sound exactly). The Chinese pronunciation is ''voiceless'' (like ''t'' and not like ''d''), but it is also ''unaspirated'' (without the puff of air which is normally a part of English ''t'' but which is never a part of English ''d''). One perspective holds that both transliterations when used in English are thus in theory technically equally close to (or far from) the [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] pronunciation of '''&amp;#36947;'''. However in practice, due to partial de-voicing of &quot;d&quot; in English in certain situations, the only reliable phonetic difference between initial /d/ and /t/ in English is aspiration, not voicing, just as in Chinese. Therefore to the ear of most English speakers the Chinese pronunciation sounds more like an English &quot;d&quot; than an English &quot;t&quot;, thus some argue that &quot;Dao&quot; is in that sense more accurate than &quot;Tao&quot;. [[User:LDHan|LDHan]] 11:23, 4 July 2006 (UTC)


----
&lt;blockquote&gt;#'' The pronunciation of Pinyin is much more intuitive for English speakers than Wade-Giles''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I find this assertion utterly ridiculous. Pinyin is not supposed to be read phonetically. For example, the letter 'q' in pinyin is pronounced 'ch', the letter 'x' is more like 'sh'.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A particular problem is that English speakers seeing Wade-Giles transliterations are likely to give widely inaccurate pronunciations; an English-speakers pronunciation of pinyin won't be perfect, but will be much closer to real Putonghua''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a Chinese, I do find that Wade-Giles gives a better sense of the pronunciation. For example, the word 'dao' has been butchered by English speakers who use the broad 'd' sound to pronounce it. The 'd' sound doesn't even exist in Chinese. In fact, the way Westerners say 'tao' is pretty close to the actual pronunciation.

I don't understand how such an obvious mistake has gotten so out of hand.

[[User:Rilie|Rilie]] 17:59, 12 November 2007 (UTC)


:&quot;Westerners&quot;?? - That is way too broad.  Which bunch of &quot;westerners&quot; do you know? [[User:Hillgentleman|Hillgentleman]] 05:13, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Westerners&quot;?? - That is way too broad''&lt;blockquote&gt;

Exactly. I was speaking generally.

[[User:Rilie|Rilie]] 17:49, 12 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/blockquote&gt;


----

Second point. Not true. Pinyin is not easier for English users, but actually for all OUTCLUDING them. Wade-Giles is made for English users. Pinyin is the best, it's very natural and very easy for Polish speaker, since many, many sounds occuring in Chinese lang. (普通话) are also in Polish. So... let westerners use WG, let other people use a standard - 汉语拼音. In my humble opinion WG is dumbed version of Chinese real pronounciation.
What's unnatural for English speaker isn't automatically for non-English speaker. Right, pinyin is better for European (Slavic) languages to use. Wade-Giles is better for English speakers, but that's it. You should drop that debate. Now pinyin is a standard. Don't fight with it. Stop crying. Period.</text>

GIS Design Model&lt;br&gt;
Getting info, organize info, analyze info

Moing from he real world to a specification to a database (working from a conceptual to an operational model)

'''Raster''' &lt;br&gt;
First widespread usage was with mapping and displaying images on TV screens. 
* It has a value for each pixel on the screen.
* rid/lattice

'''Vector'''&lt;br&gt;
* It is faster for logical expressions.
* Mathematical relationships built of &quot;nodes&quot; and &quot;lines&quot;
* The only thing stored is the [[w:coordinate]]s
 

'''Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)'''&lt;br&gt;
Series of triangles that represent an area/polygon.

'''Coverage'''

'''Region'''&lt;br&gt;
Example of having several islands/polygons, but one state/region (exm: Hawaii). The state would be the &quot;region&quot;.
* Used alot in real life; things overlap.

'''Grids'''&lt;br&gt;
They are different levels of a raster. Each of which tracks a certain types of raster values (such as vegetatin, elevation, Buildings)

'''Discrete data'''&lt;br&gt;
There is only one value for a given cell. It is unique (roads, buildings, water bodies etc.)

'''Continuous data'''&lt;br&gt;
Called grids or lattices usually floating point format (elevation, pollution, vegetation etc.)

'''String attributes in string data'''&lt;br&gt;
Point, linear, continuous types of data

'''Normalization'''&lt;br&gt;
Process of developing rules that break down the data into managable format. (process of simplifying data into a database, in order to make data management easier)
*contains repeating groups
*Owner attributes imply order
First normal form from C.J. Date (circa 1964):
*put the data in columns and rows and put only one value in each cell.
*EXM: record numbers for rows, different categories for column and values in the cells

'''Primary Keys'''&lt;br&gt;
In the previous example, the key would be the first row with the numbers; it defines what are the unique IDs. 
*If data in database changes dramatically enough, it will necessitate the changing of the key.
Good Primary Key is...&lt;br&gt;
*guaranteed unique
*never changes
*Doesn't contain embedded informaiton
*is never reused
*is available when you need it
*generated keys satisfy the above requirements

Generation of unique IDs becomes an administration issue when dealing with multiple user that need to generate them at the same time.

==== Uploads seemingly being abused? ====

2002/2/24 - If you go and have a look at the upload log, it seems much of the material is distinctly non-encyclopedic and a substantial fraction is copyrighted material. I'm not sure whether this is a policy question, feature request, or bug report, but something's got to be done. Could we restrict [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special:Upload uploads] to registered users, perhaps? --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]

:I agree 100%. I've already have had to overwrite several copyrighted binaries with text files of the same name: [http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/Calc.exe Calc.exe], [http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/Mspaint.exe Mspaint.exe], [http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/PPbanner.jpg PPbanner.jpg] (which was a copyrighted porn banner add), [http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/limp%20bizkit%20-%20fuck%20slipknot.mp3 limp bizkit - fuck slipknot.mp3] and a couple of others. There still are about a dozen uploaded files that are questionable. Included in this category are several images that appear to the commercial property of &quot;Never Take Shit&quot; (whatever that is). There also appears to be a digital book of [http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/The%20Fellowship%20of%20the%20Rings.pdb The Fellowship of the Rings] in a PalmOS format. This is serious, under the [[w:DMCA]] Wikipedia could be shut down overnight by a simple letter from a copyright holder. [[User:maveric149|maveric149]]

:Sheesh, there's a ton of stuff in there now which doesn't look like it belongs in an encyclopedia. What would ''really'' help is some way of finding out what uploads are linked to from which Wikipedia articles. That way it'd be easy to spot which aren't linked at all, and which are linked to from inappropriate articles. [[w:user:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen]]

:Also, just noticed that the link to the upload log on the Uploads page is broken. The link is http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/special%3Aupload?title=Log:Uploads which just takes you right back to the uploads page. [[w:user:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen]]

Looks like one of the primary people abusing the upload utility created an account with the oh so original name [[w:User:Lod69]] (The person really is into something called &quot;LOD&quot;). [[User:maveric149|maveric149]]

[[w:Larry Sanger|Larry]] also seems to have noticed the problem, and has deleted most of the offending material (see [[w:Log:Uploads]]). There still are some text files with names like Calc.exe, The Fellowship of the Rings.pdb, Mspaint.exe, and the former porn banner PPbanner.jpg, that Bryan and I uploaded to overwrite copyrighted material. I can see now that is was a ''bad'' idea for Bomis to let him go. Everything ran much more smoothly when he was on the wiki 40+ hours a week. [[User:maveric149|maveric149]]

&gt; &gt;From a general, Wiki-philosophical-social aspect, it is interesting&lt;br /&gt;
&gt; that the upload function gets abused, while general Wiki pages do not.&lt;br /&gt;

Actually, there's a good reason for it: the images aren't obviously linked&lt;br /&gt;
to anything in any article. This is an ABSOLUTELY essential piece of&lt;br /&gt;
information to have: what articles *use* the image in question? If no&lt;br /&gt;
article uses an image after 24 hours, perhaps we should delete the image&lt;br /&gt;
(or put it in a queue to be deleted by a human). So, the point is,&lt;br /&gt;
without a context, unless some image is at face value obviously worthless&lt;br /&gt;
to any Wikipedia article (e.g., porn advertisements), it's difficult for&lt;br /&gt;
us to tell whether an image really is appropriate for the 'pedia. It&lt;br /&gt;
would even make it easier for us to determine whether an image is&lt;br /&gt;
copyrighted.&lt;br /&gt;

One way around this would be to attach images to unique articles, so that&lt;br /&gt;
the uploading of an image would be logged in a particular article's&lt;br /&gt;
history. I don't know if I like this suggestion, though, I'm just&lt;br /&gt;
throwing it out there for your consideration.&lt;br /&gt;

Here's another thing we need in that upload form. We should ask people to&lt;br /&gt;
choose: (1) I have created this image and release it under the GNU FDL (or&lt;br /&gt;
contribute it to Wikipedia); (2) I personally certify that this image is&lt;br /&gt;
public domain (if checked, add a text box requiring that a source be&lt;br /&gt;
given--a URL or else a book title, say); (3) other? If none are checked,&lt;br /&gt;
then the uploader wouldn't accept the article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Under some schemes we might want (1) to require that the uploader identify&lt;br /&gt;
which article the image is going to be used in, and (2) to check that the&lt;br /&gt;
image title is linked to from that article. But (1) might be done&lt;br /&gt;
automatically, I guess...&lt;br /&gt;

Doing these things would remove a fair bit of the abuse. It would&lt;br /&gt;
certainly make it a lot easier for the community to act as a check on the&lt;br /&gt;
abuse.&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; Perhaps the uploads should be visible in the RecentChanges list?&lt;br /&gt;

They already are, sort of--but each one individually should be, which&lt;br /&gt;
isn't the case now.&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; Perhaps there should be a &quot;view other versions&quot; for each upload?&lt;br /&gt;

Maybe--would prevent people from uploading porn in place of legit images,&lt;br /&gt;
for instance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&gt; Perhaps a Wikipage in the upload: namespace for each uploaded object?&lt;br /&gt;

Maybe...?

Thanks for adding the above here, maveric149.

Just to add one thing to the above: it would be a semi-disaster if some vandal were to come in with a script that overwrote ''all'' our legit files. In view of that threat, it'd be good to save the history of each filename.

---
Another suggestion would be to limit what could be uploaded. So I can't imagine we would ever want to allow exe files to be uploaded (partly because we're not a software archive, but mainly because we wouldn't know what harm an exe could do). Similarly we might allow mp3 files, but less than X megs (to allow for somebody posting a copy of a Kennedy speech, but preventing the posting of songs). In fact we could probably only allow png/gif/jpg, mp3/ogg/wav. Just a thought - verloren
----
On this topic, do you think it would be ok for me to upload ~18,000 gif images over the next couple of months? I figure, this week I'll do Maine and its counties and after that I can do maps for each town and city. How much space do you guys have? --Rlee0001 (wikipedia user, not signed in here)

Please check out [[Wikipediatlas]]. Those maps look far nicer and have a chance of being a standard. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

'''Database construction'''&lt;br /&gt;
*Most expensive and time consuming part of any GIS project. (80% of time and money)
*Prior to generating new data, look for previously created data.

'''Finding existing GIS data'''&lt;br /&gt;
*knowledge, experience and luck
*Internet ; government or public agencies (may not be stable source, not right format, not in digital or correct form.)

'''Publicly available GIS data
*Federal Geogrpahic data Commitee
*USGS -- major provider of GIS data, Digital Line Grpas, vector representation of the point line and area features of US
*US Bureau of the Census. TIGER files, -- also has geocodable address indices for streets in most urban area of the country.
*States, counties municipalities and special area (SACOG)

'''Proprietary GIS data'''
*Generally, this the most accurate data is found here - slightly out of date data can be obtained for a minimal fee.
*ESRI is a good source for links

'''Metadata'''
*info about spatial data
*dry, but essential to let peole know where data came form
*ID, title, contents, currency
Gualtiy information completenness
Organization info - raster or vector&lt;br /&gt;
Reference info &lt;br /&gt;
Attribute info&lt;br /&gt;
Distribution info&lt;br /&gt; 
Metadata info&lt;br /&gt;

'''Conversin of acquired existing data'''
*data conversion 
*Direct translation (from one format to another)
*Only a limited number fof fiters are available
*conversion may also be done through use of neutral formats
*Public agencies often do this
*Also some private providers

'''Creating new data'''
*Remote sensing data
*most data are in raster data structure but can be use to make vector data input
*Digital orthophoto quads (DOQs) are photgraphic images wih resolution of 1 meter that correspond to USGS 7.6 minute quod. 

''Creating new data 
* GPS data -- uses satellites to triangulate horizontal and vertical locations
*with correction, accuracy in 3 to 5 meters

'''Digitizing table'''
*use of digitizing table - contains analog to digital data
*Discrete features are generally suitable for digitization and the process results in creation of vector data file.
*use of a puck to click where analog map coordinates are.
*Accuracy is generally within .0001 inches which is called as rmsi error in Arc info of ESRI Package - The full form of Rmsi error is root mean square error - Edited by A.Narayana Murthy.

== Headline text ==

*&quot;Control points&quot; 
Two mode:&lt;br /&gt;
*Point mode, operator slecis discrete point
*stream mode, operator traces lines to be digitized and the location of the puck is placed at set intervals

'''Scanning'''
*creates a raster files form analog map
*can be converted to vector by sectorization
*use of &quot;tracing&quot; (cheap and automated)

'''Creating New Data'''
*on screen digitizing is amhula
*used when feature are preson (GAP)

Importance of source map accuracy
*paper maps tend to shrink or expand as temperature and humidity change. The age rather vintage of the maps also contributes alot to the data that have been digitized. _ Edited by A.Narayana Murthy.
*Line work must be clean, thin and uniform

'''Geometrical Transformations'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical}}
I'm working on developing a science hypertextbook online, called (for a working title) '''Science!... in Simple Steps'''.  Given the amount of time it was taking me to work on the project, I was inspired by Wikipedia to open it to the wide wild world of Wikidom.  A friend has offered me a site and some code support, so it's now set up! At the moment it's just labeled April's Wiki, though that will change, and is using UseModWiki, though my code-guru friend is muttering noises about optimizations.   From the introductory material:

:The SimpleScienceWiki Project is a collaborative effort to develop a science hypertextbook for students at the advanced secondary school or introductory college level. It is intended to allow anyone to educate themselves on science and scientific subjects, or to review subjects they may have forgotten; it may also prove useful for structured educational programs, particularly in the area of distance learning. 

:Some goals of the project are: 

* To discuss in some detail the nature of science and the scientific method, with particular emphasis on correct and incorrect applications thereof; 
* To explain the basic principles of the sciences in simple and straightforward terms, in order to give the student the best possible grounding in these principles; 
* To give an overview of the body of well-established theory and models in a number of scientific disiplines; 
* To discuss current directions in scientific progress and their implications. 

:The use of the term &quot;simple&quot; here should not be misunderstood. It is not, for instance, expected that every student will find this information easy to absorb; that will of course depend on the student's aptitude and prior education. It is certainly not meant to imply that these topics are oversimplified or &quot;dumbed down&quot;. Rather, it's intended to convey the idea that the concepts are to be laid out in as clear a fashion as possible, without the needless confusion created by over-complex language, over-use of jargon, or the skipping of steps in explanations. 

Many of the participants in Wikipedia are, obviously, well-educated in the sciences and associated technical fields. I would be delighted beyond measure if those with an interest in science and science education would be interested in contributing.  The section on '''physics''' and '''geology''' are currently largely untouched, for instance...

      <text xml:space="preserve">This sounds like a great idea. My only question would be whether or not all content for the textbook is under the [[w:GNU FDL]] (or compatible). If it is under the FDL, then wikipedia articles can be source material. If it is not, then I for one would not contribute to the textbook. --[[user:maveric149|maveric149]]  

Yes, in fact, I just put up the GNU FDL (1.1) tonight, and revised the &quot;copyleft&quot; article to point to it and the recommended FDL statement. I'm hoping that there will be some cross-fertilization between it and Wikipedia where appropriate... but I also want to respect what Jimbo, Larry, and The Great Wikipedian Consensus think of as &quot;fair use&quot; in that department.  To me, that means I can port anything ''I'' wrote to either project (as could anyone else) but I'd want to use reasonable courtesy in any other uses. In short, I don't intend to grab great raw chunks of Wikipedian stuff for SimpleScience, and likewise won't grab other contributors' SimpleScience stuff for Wikipedia.  My own, though, I shall gladly donate. :)  [[user:-- April|-- April]]

You might ask Jimbo either by e-mail or on Wikipedia-L what he thinks of this, but it sounds great to me.  I have no objections.  It doesn't sound like a fork; it sounds like a complementary project that can supply and be supplied by Wikipedia (and Nupedia) with content.  That's the way open content ''should'' work!  --[[user:Larry_Sanger|Larry_Sanger]]

The more I think about it, the less clear in my mind is the difference between a good hypertextbook article and a good Wikipedia article. What is the most significant difference, in your opinion, folks? Are 'pedia articles supposed to be more pedantic and obscure by comparison to textbook entries?
[[user:Seb|Seb]]

My opinion is that the major differences seem to be in ''organization'' and ''approach''.  As far as organization goes, Wikipedia articles are supposed to be fairly well self-contained, while hypertextbook articles are supposed to be part of a logical &quot;flow&quot; from one subject to another, where prior reading of certain previous articles can be assumed.  In approach, Wikipedia articles need to, most importantly, give a summary of the most important lines of thought on any given topic. Hypertextbook articles, on the other hand, need to ''explain'' the basics of the topic, with examples, breakdowns into component steps, et cetera.  But that's just my thinking.  [[user:-- April|-- April]]

This project sounds like a great idea!  I've thought for some time that copylefted textbooks could be useful in education.  It's also nice to see that people are being inspired by Wikipedia to create similar collaborative projects.  Good luck!

Suppose my question is, what makes this different from Wikipedia? One thing I noticed about Wikipedia is that the science articles are some of the more &quot;done&quot; articles, I assume because a lot more people know about Mitochondria then some obscure historical person. So, how are you planning your articles to be different then Wikipedia's science articles? Not over using jargon while not dumbing-down is certainly one of the goals of any encyclopedia. - [[w:user:Eean]]

We're discussing this in the Talk page. Take a look. [[user:Seb|Seb]]  '''(Now moved to Talk! [[user:-- April|-- April]])'''

* Since this has come up again, I'll try for a more comprehensive answer on why I thought a spinn-off project was needed for this purpose.  Essentially: it ''would'' in theory be possible to educate oneself about science from the [[w:Wikipedia]]. However, it would, I think, be a rather haphazard process. You would have to know what topics to look for in the first place in order to get the most out of it, and I question whether a novice would know to look, e.g., at [[w:precession]] at all.  Certainly some topics would lead to other topics, but the hit-and-miss approach risks that a good deal would be missed.

* In addition, there's the question of ''prior knowledge''. Many topics in the sciences build on other topics, to ever-increasing levels of complexity. Rather than throwing students into the deep end, I'm envisioning a more structured approach... first reviewing the basic concepts, then building on those to the more complex and/or less intuitive ideas.  Plus, of course, there will later come elements which have no real place in Wikipedia - problem sets, question-and-answer boards, et cetera.
::If unreasonable amounts of prior knowledge is required for a Wikipedia article, then something is being done wrong. That being said, I can now see how you differentiating yourself. - [[w:user:Eean]]

Hi April, Im the one who emailed you earlier today, I would have posted here but after a while of looking around could still not find it (obviously I am somewhat new to the Wiki). I am very excited about the idea of a Wiki textbook site and interested in contributing to it. I have felt for some time that the world needs free online textbooks. I am currently writing a physics book to sell at my local university bkstore and want to post the contents online with free access, and the idea of making it open for edits and additions sounds great. I just started an organic chemistry textbook page on Wikipedia but some kid told me that I cant do that and its under the deletion process ... I might like to use a lot of the existing information on Wikipedia for modules but be able to have a truly textbook-like structure to tie it together. I love the idea of a non-linear book where each module has the references that a student can use to get the background needed for any subject, as hypertext allows. If I got seriously involved in the project Id like to eventually move it to an easily-memorable URL and lay down the seeds for all kinds of online, open-content textbooks available at one source. I wonder if over time we could recoup costs by allowing schools to have subsets of the information in non-editable form, and pay us for the service. However my main interest is not in money but in the free flow of information. I am finishing up some courses at a university and think that it is ridiculous that students pay hundreds of dollars for books that contain information that is all commonly available. Thats a huge way to keep poorer people from getting an education ! I have a lot of dreams and fantasies about how this project could help people and lead to good changes in education at several levels (I realize that you are interested in primary/early college, I guess that that is about my goal too, one problem is how to present material in a flexible way so that very preliminary students could use it as well as advanced ones ... aka junior high vs doctorate ...) Get in contact with me if you are interested in chatting. Best of luck, --[[w:user:Karlwick]]

:You don't need to worry much about where to work on such a project or how to pay the bills since we already plan on eventually using Wikipedia as a source of material to write textbooks. The trouble has been with finding a good name for such a project and to lay down criteria that would make it sufficiently different from what Wikipedia is (which is far more than a combo encyclopedia/almanac/gazetteer) so that it could flourish on its own.  

:I've already purchased the domain name for [[Wiktionary]] (a wiki-based multilingual dictionary/thesaurus) and [[Wikimedia]] (the future name of our parent non-profit organization that will be responsible for paying all the bills by managing donations and grants) and would also be more than happy to purchase the domain name for a [[en:Wiki|Wiki]]/[[en:GNU FDL|GNU FDL]]-based textbook project (so long as somebody can think of a snappy name - WikiTex might work or even the more verbose WikiTextbooks). A good name seems to be very important in starting a new project. 

:One thing that I can think of off the top of my head that would be fundamentally different between Wikipedia and a textbook project is that a textbook necessarily will have to be written in the POV of whatever discipline the textbook is being written for. So an article on [[en:evolution|evolution]] in a biology textbook would concentrate on the biological concept and not the controversy. It would also state certain things as fact that would otherwise be heavily attributed in Wikipedia (in conformance with our [[NPOV]] policy). For example, a geology textbook would state, as fact, that the earth is billions of years old.  

:However, this is really an advanced derivative project and I would like to first see how far Wikipedia can go before we seriously consider steering human resources away from the encyclopedia (there still is so much work to be done in many areas). We also need to work out how a hypertext textbook would function (I'm not yet convinced that it would be too different than the way Wikipedia already works - hence I fear some duplication of effort). NOTE: [[Jimbo Wales]] is the guy who currently is paying the bills so his would be the final word on any such project - but I'm certain he would be all for the idea (so long as the reservations I expressed above are met). --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

Hey -- I copied this and put it on my talk page along with my answer to your answer .... [[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Karlwick Karl]]

And Ill post it here:

---

I think that there are some basic ways that a Wiki textbook project would be different from Wikipedia. 

One big difference is that an encyclopedia imparts general knowledge while a textbook leads a person thru a subject, helping them prepare for an exam or some other practical application.

Textbooks serve specific audiences for specific purposes you have different learning levels as well as different goals. An anatomy book for a middle-schooler wont be much like one for a med student  

A textbook is intimate. Like you said, sometimes it helps it to have a voice. 

Importantly, a textbook also involves a higher level of organization than an encyclopedia  a thread that ties the subject together. It doesnt have to be linear but its not good enough for someone wanting to learn the topics generally covered in Bio 101 to go to the Wikipedia page on biology and follow all the links ad infinitum.  

Here is what I imagine for a wiki textbook site: a central database of modules like those found on the Wikipedia, and probably linked right into the Wikipedia. However we would need the opportunity to create parallel pages where people can have alternative ways to present overlapping ideas. The books would be on separate pages, at some level of outline with links to everywhere inside. Compilers should be able to pick the most appropriate modules for their texts as well as modify existing modules for the purposes of their specific audience and purpose without necessarily changing the source page for all humanity. 

The site should support multiple books on the same subject, and if this is to be adopted into the mainstream an author must have some level of control over the final work. What I mean is, if you tell some prof that the book he compiles for his class is open to be changed at any moment that is going to depress the rate of adoption. This is especially true for K-12. This comes into the area of multiple copies   the prof has his copy set aside for his class. Everyone else could view and copy from it but have limited modifying privileges. 

What do you think ? 

PS About the name  we can agree that this is important. I am going to throw out a crazy idea here  maybe we should name the site based on what it does and will mean to an average person, like opentextbook.net or onlinetextbook.org or (brace) mytextbook.com OK not the last one, people will think it is a pay site. It should communicate something about what makes it unique. Now, the term Wiki to most people means nothing. It is also hard to say. Noone seems to understand it the until I spell it, they hear wickedpedia. 

Onlinetextbook.org is my bet because it is easy to remember and draws attention to the first thing that makes it different than a traditional textbook, the fact that it is available anywhere. Opentextbook sounds too iffy, if its open maybe its no good (judgments aside, that is the idea many people will have). And if we throw around the Wiki word a lot it is going to obfuscate  people will find out about the wiki soon enough without thowing it in their faces. Online learning is the key, not the tool that we use.

:Hm. What you just described doesn't sound like a wiki at all. &quot; Everyone else could view and copy from it but have limited modifying privileges.&quot; That's not good at all and is counter to the Wikimedia family's open nature. If we followed the concept that articles have one author and that others simply make small additions/corrections/comments then Wikipedia (our largest project thus far) would be like [[en:Nupedia|Nupedia]] and have fewer than a hundred articles. We already know such a scheme will not work so any wiki-based textbook would have to open for everyone to edit - just like Wikipedia and Wiktionary. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have milestone read-only releases that have been &quot;certified&quot; by field experts (we have been toying with this idea for Wikipedia for some time now). It ''does'' mean that the development version should always be editable by everyone. Wiki is central to what the Wikimedia family is so it is important to at least try to incorporate &quot;wiki&quot; or at least &quot;wik&quot; into the name of the project. By the time the first textbook would near 1.0 status Wikipedia will be so famous that the &quot;Wiki=Wicked or Wicca&quot; bastardized cognate will no longer resonate in any but the most uninformed ears. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

I agree that everything should remain openly editable. Also I agree that the term Wiki will continue to grow in recognition. 

What do you think about the idea of having multiple/simultaneous versions ? Would it work to have multiple pages on the same topic yet aimed at different audiences and with different goals ?

[http://wikipedia.com/wiki/User_talk:Karlwick Karlwick]

:Having different textbooks in each area (primary school, middle school, secondary school, vocational and college/university) is a worthwhile goal. But IMO it would be unwieldy to have a page by page equivalence. It may work but I'm doubtful. --mav

Thank you for your continued help. I may be getting ahead of myself, maybe its just better to worry about today and let the other stuff work itself out over time. One thing I do know, is that when I tried to start an organic chemistry textbook on Wikipedia a week or two ago it was deleted because Wikipedia is &quot;not the place&quot; for textbooks. --[[User:KarlWick]]

:Yep. For two main reasons: Textbooks are not organized at all like a hyperlinked encyclopedia (with the goal of directing a person through a logical sequence of coursework) and textbooks have a POV which in inconsistent with [[NPOV]]. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

When I came accross Wikipedia I thought that its underlying software and concept would be great for putting my physics book on the web. If other people have a similar idea I'd rather be part of the larger effort. Maybe my organizational or &quot;visionary&quot; ideas are not of use to you right now but if you can help me have a place to start getting stuff on the web, I'll do it, and it wont be bad stuff. (I dont have much IT background so it would probably take me a real long time to figure out how to do all of the technical part anyway). BTW I think that hypertext textbooks will eventually be even better learning tools than the traditional ones ... and am eager to start proving it. ---[http://wikipedia.com/wiki/User_talk:Karlwick Karlwick]

:If you are eager to get to work then ask a developer via the mailing list to set-up http://textbook.wikipedia.org with a blank Wiki. We can use what you have already to work out organizational issues and hopefully in time we can think of a snappy name that will help draw-in contributors. The worst thing that would happen is that nobody will be very interested in the idea and that wiki will be a lonely place (like our Sep11wiki). --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

---------------
From an email post to the en.wiki mailing list:

The POV of whatever textbook is being worked on 
should be a &quot;Discipline Point Of View.&quot; This means that if a textbook is on 
Biology then the POV of biologists should be in the book. There will be 
neutrality rules but they only apply from within whatever discipline the 
textbook is being written for. So for example a chapter on evolution would 
focus on the major differing views on the subject that exist from within the 
biological sciences but it would not seriously consider the POV of groups 
outside the biological sciences. 

The reason why our encyclopedias have to be NPOV is because our audience is a 
general one. The reason why our textbooks have to be DPOV is because our 
audience is very focused (the biology student, for example) and we need to 
bring that student through the material in a logical and efficient way. 

Same thing is true for a section of a medical textbook on abortion ; we leave 
out most of the history and the different political views on the subject and 
just talk about the procedure itself and maybe have a single paragraph at the 
end sating something about access to the procedure and that risks doctors 
face when they choose to specialize in this area. 

So textbooks are inherently POV - that is why each time somebody tried to 
write a textbook in Wikipedia their efforts were quickly thwarted.

Textbooks are organized in a very different way than an encyclopedia and they 
also have a specific audience. These two things make textbook material 
completely incompatible with Wikipedia. Thus a separate project is needed 
(and probably a few tweaks to the software to make it easy to have chapters).

---[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

Also:
The goal of an encyclopedia is to present a summary of the sum total of all 
human knowledge known about a particular subject. The goal of a textbook is 
to focus on one particular part of that knowledge so that students can learn 
about that aspect in detail. 
--[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

:As mentionned on the mailing list as well, I disagree with Mav. I consider a textbook will not necessarily benefit from being set from a DPOV. ''This acronym is just the perfect example of a POV opinion of what a textbook should be''. Mav consider education must be first of all a &quot;logical and efficient&quot; way to teach students a way to quickly learn techniques. Other cultures consider this it not necessarily the primary goal of education, and that by focusing too much on a topic without trying to understand the ''big picture'' is not the best way to educate a human being. And the big picture cannot be understood if the reader stick to one discipline only. [[User:Anthere]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">March 1, 2002

Dear friends:

I hereby resign as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and I also hereby give up
any position of authority I had with Wikipedia; assuming particularly that
funding will not be able to be found for the position of Nupedia
editor-in-chief (see below), I don't intend to work on either project any
significant amount within the next few months, and very possibly ever.

Obviously, I owe you an explanation.

First, let me stress that this has ''nothing'' to do with my lack of faith
in the projects or in the nobility of the mission.  It also has absolutely
nothing to do with my relationship with Jimbo or Bomis, which remains
friendly.  I really ''do'' hope the projects go on to great successes, even
without me.  It is even still possible even that Bomis, or a future
Nupedia Foundation, will find the money to pay for my job, and I might be
in a position to come back to the old job.  But I'm frankly not expecting
this.

As you know, since the beginning of February, I've been working on
Wikipedia and Nupedia as a part-time volunteer.  I haven't been able to do
nearly as much as I wish I could do, but job-hunting and money-making
activities necessarily occupy a great deal of my time.  Unfortunately, I
do not expect to see, within the foreseeable future, any sort of
compensation for the time and responsibility I've continued to hold in the
projects.  Now that I'm unemployed, I can ill afford to spend my free time
this way.  This is, I'm afraid, ''by far'' the most important reason for my
resignation.

Second, a little bit of history will help to explain this as well.  I was
more or less offered the job of editing Nupedia when I was, as an ABD
philosophy graduate student, soliciting Jimbo's (and other friends')
advice on a website I was thinking of starting.  It was the first I had
heard of Jimbo's idea of an open content encyclopedia, and I was delighted
to take the job.  So I want this to be clear: I did not ''set out'' to be a
leader and crusader and organizer.  As a job, this has been the best I've
ever had.  But this project is not something I would have chosen as a
hobby, frankly; ''with my spare time,'' even after having started it
and having grown to care a lot about it, I must admit I'd rather be
spending time with my wife, reading and writing philosophy, and playing
fiddle.  (I'm making a little money now teaching fiddle in Columbus and
enjoying that immensely.)

A third important reason is that I feel I simply cannot do a good job
working only part-time.  It seems like every time I sit down to do a
little work on Wikipedia or Nupedia, I am now asking myself, &quot;What's the
use?  I don't have any time to do anything of importance.&quot;  If I can't do
the job right, what's the point of doing it at all?

So--I wish Wikipedia all the best and hope that it can find its way
forward without my involvement.  Wikipedians, don't take my departure as
an excuse to leave yourself.  My departure should not be taken as a
reflection on Wikipedia, or you.  It still might succeed brilliantly.
It's very important that you continue to edit each others' work, that you
encourage in each other good habits, that you welcome new contributors,
and that you praise good work when you see it.  As for Nupedia, obviously,
the only way it can be revived is if it either finds money to pay an
editor-in-chief or perhaps an emeritus professor who is willing to
volunteer.  I am no longer going to ''pretend'' to be able to be
editor-in-chief as a part-time volunteer--even if I had the desire and the
spare time. I'd be interested in helping to organize it--again--as an
employee, but I'm not holding my breath.

I will try to assist in any transitioning, if any needs to be done (e.g.,
listservs I now moderate will probably have to be made unmoderated).  I
should continue to be reachable at [mailto:lsanger@nupedia.com lsanger@nupedia.com], but not via
mailing lists (I'll be unsubscribing).  Otherwise, I feel a clean break is
necessary.  I have no hard feelings at all for Jimbo or the others at
Bomis, and I wish to thank and say &quot;best wishes&quot; to--well, a long list of
people in both Wikipedia and Nupedia. You know who you are.  If you don't
mind, I'd rather not name names, for fear of leaving anyone out.

By the way, if you've got a serious job lead for me, please let me know.  :-)

All the best,
&lt;br&gt;Larry Sanger, Ph.D.
&lt;br&gt;Ex-editor-in-chief, Nupedia
&lt;br&gt;Ex-chief organizer, Wikipedia

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bipolar, living with.



This is something that people live with everyday.  Sometimes it's easy to get through a period of being manic or depressed or what is called a 'mixed state'.  Sometimes, though, it is NOT easy.  Through medication (which can be hell unto itself) and other techniques such as therapy it can be managed to a fairly high degree.  It's not something that is curable, that can be 'fixed', or forgotten.  One must involve him or herself in it completely to understand it in order to function in today's society with all of its' stigmas, thoughts of 'asylums', the abnormal use of the word 'normal'.  The more one understands the disorder the more one can do about it and do more to help yourself.  GET A GOOD DOCTOR!  Many doctors think they know all about what's going on but everyone has a slightly different chemistry thusly making the point that your treatment is as individual as you are.  People seem to lose track of that.  SUPPORT from friends and/or family is paramount to keeping your feet on the ground sometimes.  It's hard to find someone who you can talk to about it without being judged for something that isn't your fault.

'''Attribute data input and management'''

spatial and attribute data are different
*spatioal data realtres to the geometry of map heatures (how points, lines ploygons are related)
*attribute data are stored in tables with each row of the table representing a map feature and each column a characteristic.

=== Spatial data editing ===
two kinds of relational database models
*georelational data model - spatial data are stored in one table and attibute date stored in another. related by a common feature.
*object-oriented data model - distinguishes between spatial and attrit data, but keeps both spatial and attribute data in the same data.

=== Linking attribut to spatial data ===
*each map feature has a unique label ID 
*attribute data are sored in the feature attribute table
*rows = record of (tuples)
*columns = fields (items)

=== Multiple tables ===
Most GIS tables have many attiributes. The alternative is to store different layers of attributes in separate fiedls managed by a database management system (DBMS).

=== Attribute data types ===
data type must be specified for each field of an attribute table. :
character strings, integers, real numbers dattes, time intervals.

=== Attirbute data types ===
*Nominal = labels used for ID purposes only
*Ordinal = labels imply a ranking relationship 
*Interval = labels that specify the intercal between calues. (addition and subtraction are meaningful)
*Ratio = interval data for which an absolute zero in specified. All math functions meaningful. 

== Retational databases==
*Flat files - one large table (many fields)
*Hierarchical - data organized at different levels and uses a on to many association between levels.
*Network - linkages built across data tables
*Relational - a collection of tables (or realtions) connected to each other by keys (one or more attriutes that uniquely ID a record in a table; a key common to two tables can connect the corresponding records across tables. 
*Tables remain separate until a query is asked requiring attribute data from different tables. 

=== Normalization ===
Taking a flat file and decomposing it into several small tables to achieve the following objectives:
*to avoid redundant data that waste space and may cause data integrity problems
*To ensure that attributes in separate tables can be maintained and updated spearately and linked only when needed.

=== Types of relationship ===
none to one, many to one, one to many

=== one to one ===
one and only one record in the destination table.
 
=== one to many === 
one record in the desination table may be related to more than one rocrd in the source table.

=== many to one ===
more than one roeco in the desination table may be related to a field.

== Introduction ==
For my project I propose to collect data on several light rail stations in the downtown area of Sacramento. For each station I plan on collecting information about the number and type of services that are within ¼ mile and ½ mile radius from the light rail station. For example I plan on using an online telephone directory to search for a certain type of service within the area code of the light rail station. By service I mean such things as grocery stores, banks, ATMs, spatiality shops, cafés etc. The point of this exercise is to see what types of services are within walking distance from the various light rail stations. Analysis can then be done to compare the number and type of services available to particular stations. Other information, like relative usage of each station could then be inputted. Further analysis could then be done to compare the relative usage of a transit station against the distance that a particular service is from the station.

== Raster data structures ==

Cector data structre is good for siaplay discrete features, not.
Raster data structure is good fo coverages, generates calure for every cell in a grid.

Examples
*elevation data, satellite imagery, orthophotes, scanned maps, graphic files

Way use raster?
*large additonal set of GIS analyses, most GIS software allow simultaneous display a and alysis of reawster and vecotor data.

== Componets ==
*Grid consistis of rows and columns
*Point is difine by a whole cell in raster model
*line is defined by a sequence of neighboring cells
*Areas are represented by collections of contiguous cells. 

Cells
*integer vlues represent categorical data
*floating point numbers typically represtend continuous data

*No spearation between spatial and attrbute data
*resolution is determined by cell size. large cells can't represent the precise locacton of spatial features.

*greid is usually projected on a coordinate system like UTM 
*Grid data have fied cell location

=== Types of raster data ===
remote sensed images (Landsate, AVHRR)
*SPOT imagery from France
*all need separtate image processig software (RDAS and ER Mapper)
*Digital Elevation Models (array of uniformly spaced elevation data that is point based)

=== Digital orthophot quad ===
*processed aerial photographs to remove distortion caused by camera tilt and relief
*georeferenced
*can be registerd with topographic can other maps

=== Digital raster graphics ===
*scanned USGS topo map

=== Graphic fies ===
TIFF, GIF, and JPEG

=== Encoding ===
*cell by cell encoding (every cell has a value in the grid) = no compression, used for DEMs 
*Run length encoding (only mention cells that have a specific value &amp;amp; then only note the beginning and end values of each row) = some compression of data
*Chain code compression (records the boundary of a region of redundant values by specifyin cardinal direction) = greater amount of compression
*Block code compression (breaks raster region into square blocks) = stars by stating 

=== Compression ===
*Lossless or reversible compression 
*Lossy or Irreversible compression 
MrSID (multi-resolution seamless image datbase) allows ecalliung the image at differeent scales and resutions
*Zip, tar

=== Distortion ===
Warping or rubber sheeting ay be needed to allow the closest fit between raster and vector data (georeferencing)

=== Conversion ===
rasteriation or vectorization of data (both need computer algorihms)

=== Integration ===
allow for processin of sicrete and continuopus data at the same time.

''Work in progress''


I'm a fan of the Wikipedia because it's a '''[[w:consensus|consensus]]''' effort. This happens to fit in neatly with some of my ideas about the most productive forms of social interaction. Someday, I'd like to see a similar setup for a discussion of human rights, the better to work toward an international consensus on the fundamental rights that should be granted to every human being.  Hey, everybody's got to have a dream...

=== What is Consensus? ===

A consensus is a general agreement among the members of a given community.  Such agreement need not be unanimous*, but the word implies more than a simple majority.  The closest equivalent phrase might be the  &quot;collective opinion&quot; of a group, keeping in mind that some degree of variation is still possible among individuals in  that group on the topic. 

The word also holds implications of compromise.  Rather than one opinion being adopted by a plurality, consensus suggests that various different opinions are brought together and adapted until a single &quot;average&quot; statement is reasonably representative of the whole. The articles of Wikipedia are intended to follow this kind of approach. 

The concept of consensus is an important one in the context of society and government, and forms a cornerstone of the concept of democracy.  Democracy, in its raw form, has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, with the implication that one faction of the society is dominating other factions, possibly repressively.  Others, however, argue that if the democracy adheres to the principles of consensus, factional dominance can be minimized and decisions will be most representative of the entire society. 

=== Consensus and Wikipedia ===

*The fact that one individual can remove any given edit makes Wikipedia based on unanimity not consensus.  The two models of editing are quite incompatible.

If any two individuals had to agree to authorize the visibility of a given edit or to undo it, they could over-ride the authority of the single author.  Thus the encyclopedia would not rely on unanimous consent but on 'unanimity minus one'.  It is quite possible to base the encyclopedia on any algorithm of measuring consent, but 'unanimity minus one' has significant advantages.</text>

This page contains proposed revisions to the NPOV policy article.  As far as I, [[user:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] am concerned, the spirit of the NPOV policy and Larry's (bless his contributions) expansions should stay.  However, there are certain features of the article that require some minor revision, but before any changes are made I believe that it would be appropriate to discuss them here.

----
:''I agree with the nonbias policy but there are some here who seem completely, irremediably biased.  I have to go around and clean up after them.  What do I do?''

:This is a very difficult question.

:Unless the case is really egregious, maybe the best thing is to call attention to the problem publicly, pointing the perpetrators to this page (but politely--one gets more flies with honey) and asking others to help.  If the problem is really serious, [[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]] might be enlisted to beat the person over the head (so to speak) and, in the most recalcitrant cases, ask them to leave the project.  There must surely be a point beyond which our very strong interest in being a completely open project is trumped by the interest the vast majority of our writers have, in being able to get work done without constantly having to fix the intrusions of people who do not respect our policy.

The problem here, of course, is that [[Larry Sanger]] is not around to beat people over the head any more.  

I would suggest the following revision to the sentence mentioning Larry:

:If the problem is really serious, experienced and respected Wikipedians might be enlisted to beat the person over the head (so to speak) and, in the most recalcitrant cases, ask them to leave the project.

In the absence of the Pandora's box that establishing some more formal governance structure for Wikipedia will undoubtedly be (though it is something the project will have to tackle if it continues to grow as it has) is the above sufficient?  --[[user:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]
----
It seems to me that the above implies several deviations from what I understand the project to be, admittedly I have only been around a few months and only read the documentation available on the front page a few times.  Also, I view the &quot;owners&quot; of the domain and Bomis as equal participants despite some of the heavy handedness some desire of Larry as a representive of the communities established editorial policy.  I reason thusly .... the database and code are available if necessary to fork.  Also,  Jimbo Wale's repeated statements that we take it slow and easy and continue to incrementally evolve the project and his refusal to be heavy handed, despite controlling the domain and physical resources.

Deviations:
1.  We are not beating anybody up.  We are inviting the entire public to use our wikipedia, data and code.  This is what the FPL and GPL imply.  Granted we do not have to let them edit until they download into their own web space if they are too irritating.   This is at odds with several community members ardent desire to put barriers in the way of forking.  Thus we have a bit of schizophrenia here.

2.  Why jump to asking if it is suffient?  Is it necessary?
Perhaps we could establish a new article zone on meta where controversial articles could be written/edited/neutralized with newcomer's until they are better editors with an implicit understanding of our community standards.

This would also give the newcomer the chance to begin impacting the community's common fabric.  I anticipate it would be the butterflies, tweakers, and &quot;editors&quot; among us such as I, 24, Merkle, maveric etc. who would participate in such an exercise room.  Thus we invite obnoxious overly energetic newcomers (we need not worry about occasional users .... it is the potential wikipediasts, enthusiasts and activists gone amok that we are talking about ..... so it seems to me anyway) to the appropriate educational section and help them massage their articles of interest until it works for them and complies with the applicable NPOV.

3.  Is part of the problem that existing wikipediasts are getting attached to articles which newcomers are changing or  existing prolific people with community stature wish to maintain that community stature?   Is dilution perceived as a threat?  If so, then our implicit community fabric needs to evolve to deal with implications of near term and future recruiting efforts. 

4.  I agree that some form of configuration management and &quot;governance&quot; will probably evolve either here or at some derivative forked sites.   Meta seems a pretty good innovation ..... the front page discussion here seems to imply that not many wikipediasts are currently interested in these issues or that sufficient agreement has been reached for most, even if not rigidly documented .... I go now to review the evolving front page ... april's rewrite of much of it was very good last time I looked it over.

[[w:user:mirwin]]
----

--------
The question is, when these people edit articles, do they generally get better, or worse, over time?  Everyone looks at the world in a certain way.  Personally I have a whole theory of what NPOV is, and it's more &quot;embodied&quot; than the one in force here.  I often find people saying things that I find inane or stupid - although they are probably closer to &quot;common sense&quot; than I am... but I'm not here to tell other people how smart I am, I'm here to rewrite until the thing makes sense... and the article always turns out better.

It's everyone's own personal capacity for nitpicking that determines how much energy they put into editing.   And of course some people deliberately only write on very controversial topics - specializing in finding the very narrow tightrope between warring fanatics...

Those people are going to annoy you more than the ones who crib history books.  But they're also a lot more valuable.  They make this a better resource than Brittannica simply by daring to write, be corrected, write again, be flamed, rewrite again, etc., - something a corporation can't economically do for a minor topic.

So, there is an upside to being in constant rewrite.  The closer one gets to the issue of NPOV itself, the more &quot;meta value&quot; there is in an given debate.  All our choices are ethical choices... we decide what to ignore, and that may determine what is paid attention to in the larger world.

the social capital of this group is one thing, but the way we agree on &quot;neutrality&quot; is another... it's an opportunity to be here, now, doing this, so I don't find it burdensome to edit something 10x to deal with nitpicker objections.

they might find it burdensome to nitpick that much - but if the result is a great article on a tough topic that whole civilizations have gone to war for failure to agree on, heck, that's worth the time.

don't you think?

:Personally I find those people more interested in starting arguments than writing articles annoying, and, if they do nothing but peeve people and nothing else works, they *should* be asked to leave.  I basically think the policy was fine, except for the fact Larry's not here any more. --[[Robert Merkel]]
------
Skips over the question of *who* asks who to leave - is there an election to establish an editor, or an &quot;editorial party&quot;?

A lot of empires fell apart when their founder died... a policy that relied ultimately on one person's judgement was really not much of a policy at all.

People focus on conflicts more than outcomes.  If out of 50 articles there are significant questions about 10, and significant arguments about 5, and unresolved and annoying arguments about 2, people tend to remember the 2...
highlighting the need for a governance process.

People interested in meta are interested in meta, and will debate it more happily and get into it quicker - the payoff is that once they understand the meta issue, they tend never to make the same mistake twice... and issues with them tend to be genuine political or values questions, not style or lexical...

the most controversial thing here is the idea that morals (mores) and ethics (ethos) have reversed their meaning since ancient Greek times.  IT's a very powerful argument.  What's wrong with it?
: dunno, I find I agree with it.  But perhaps it's a translation issue?  That is, modern English word 'morals' means what the Greeks meant by 'ethos' (character), and modern English word 'ethics' means what the Greeks meant by 'mores' (rules), and the crossover was a result of constant push on both over thousands of years, which reversed our ideas of how human behavior is conducted?  
::Actually, I use 'ethics' to mean something the Greeks didn't have or didn't think much about until philosophers got their hands on the language. 'Ethics' can mean morals, but to my ear it always has connotations of 'science', or a philosophy of morals. (It meant, 'about character'.) I think the meaning you mention came from people thinking of their morals as philosophically/scientifically certain. But I suppose ethos has come to mean mores, and morals can sometimes mean character.--Dan

I found the comment regarding &quot;adultery&quot; a bit jarring until  considering that perhaps the writer used it in a legalistic  way such as breaking contracts/marriage vows sanction by the state/society rather than the standard judgemental way many &quot;Christians&quot; seem to fall into.   I also am curious where this material is too controversial for the main site as it seems a reasonable layman's introduction that I can link to from a more specialized &quot;engineering ethics&quot;.  In engineering it is more about tradeoffs in the context of conflicting societal goals or &quot;right&quot; vs. &quot;right&quot; as this article puts it.  [[user:mirwin]]

---
This article used to be quite prominent on the main meta page, and now it is buried.  Obviously we can't talk 'metas' at all without some common view of morality and ethical behavior... so without this as an introduction, we are going to have more and more chaos.  No one should be writing in meta without at least reading this, since we all seem to have some agreement about it.

Also, isn't it time this article was moved to the main wikipedia?

:yeah, probably, and to the French wiki, since thre is now an article in French that links to it.

::Agreed. But translated then...

----

I very much disagree that ethics is the science of morals.  Ethics is a moral philosophy, or a type of morals.  The other principle moral type is deontological morals, which denotes a moral system that is claimed to have been arbitrarily dictated by a higher power.  Ethics, on the other hand, is a moral system that is based on reason directed towards using methods and achieving consequences which serve the greatest good.  Deep ethics implies that ethics must be extended not only to all people, but to all life, and that we each are responsible for every consequence of our every action.  Thus, if I buy Exxon gas, I bear responsibility in part for human-rights abuses in Nigeria.  Deontological morals tend to be far more simplistic and unreasoned.  The ten commandments are a good example, in which almost half the commandments are admonitions by a vain god to worship only him. [[User:Jaknouse|Jaknouse]] 04:19 25 Mar 2003 (UTC)
: A deontological theory needs not claim to have been dictated by a higher power and can well be based on reason. For example, Kantian ethics is a deontological theory. If a theory is deontological, that means its emphasis is on moral obligation, on duty, as opposed to e.g. the consequences of an action.</text>

Is there a '''natural point of view''' that is even less biased than the [[neutral point of view]]?  Some argue that there is, and that over time the neutral view tends to the natural view, as empirical evidence displaces dogma and long-held beliefs.  

The natural point of view is better known as an &quot;embodied&quot; or &quot;body within ecology&quot; point of view &amp;mdash; the word &quot;natural&quot; is however evocative of, and easier to contrast with, views from the Enlightenment era.

==What's &quot;natural&quot;?==
One interpretation of that argument is that science has conquered religion, or more generally, that reason conquered faith.  This view is generally associated with [[w:The Enlightenment]] and has led to theories of [[w:natural law]] which influenced [[w:Evolution of societies]] especially in the scientific era.  It has been very influential, especially at increasing human physical comfort, increasing tolerance between followers of various religious dogmas, and at the creation of spectacular [[w:weapons of mass destruction]].

These examples highlight why we might choose to avoid a &quot;natural&quot; point of view in favor of a &quot;neutral&quot; view de-escalating inter-human conflict.  Or, alternatively, why we might choose to pursue and extend a &quot;natural&quot; point of view very deeply so as to cast light on the dangers of strict moral neutrality.  The debate is unlikely to be resolved in the lifetime of anyone reading this.  Some believe that it can only be summarized after the fact, as were [[w:The Renassiance]] and [[w:The Enlightenment]], by a history of what some are already calling [[w:The Embodiment]].

===The &quot;old neutral&quot;?===
We [[w:Americentrism|English-speaking]] internet users are [[w:cultural bias|by definition]] [[w:divine grace|privileged]] people [[w:ethnocentrism|compared to others]] in the world.  Those of us who write for others to read have some [[w:white man's burden|obligation]] to reach &quot;out and down&quot; to those less priveleged, and whose traditional world-views are in danger of being threatened by our work compiling what purports to be &quot;useful knowledge&quot; from a &quot;neutral point of view&quot;.  Most of us would view, in line with this history, a sort of progress through [[w:The Renaissance]] and [[w:The Enlightenment]] leading to what we think of as objective unbiased thinking.  But in all previous eras of history, dominant cultures believed this, no matter how wrong they were.

====An alternate take====
An idea somewhat common among technical people:  We speak for ourselves .... if other cultures are too lazy or incapable of publishing their thoughts then we help them publish or wire for broadcast but it is their responsbility to then use the resources provided to engage others with alternate world views with regard to their own.  The awesome power of the internet; and the '''wikipedia''' or its derivatives; is that when the 3 Billionth or ten thousandth user arrives ..... they can make  appropriate tweaks for themselves.   We only have to approximate neutral presentation of various cases the best we can, each new consensus should improve the approximation.  [[user:mirwin]]

===The &quot;new natural&quot;?===
Today, [[w:cognitive science]] and [[w:anthropology]] appear to be challenging a [[w:foundation ontology]], based on physics and the [[w:scientific method]], that was also inherited from [[w:The Enlightenment]].  Some dismiss this challenge as postmodern hogwash.  Others take it very seriously and point to advances towards a [[w:cognitive science of mathematics]], the [[w:anti-globalization movement]], and even the rise of [[w:Green Parties]], as evidence that even such commonly-held notions as mathematical proofs and the hard sciences may gain most of their reality from human observers whose hominid body is part of an evolving ecology.  This view is popular among those who challenge [[w:Eurocentrism]] and mind-sets inherited from an era of [[w:colonization]].  It is also popular among those who see humans simply as arrogant [[w:Hominidae]] and perhaps identify more with the plight of the [[w:Great apes]] they extinct.

These are tough political questions, challenging our most basic sense of ourselves, and they will not be resolved by a few entries on [[w:primatology]].

Like the &quot;old natural&quot; point of view that characterized [[w:The Enlightenment]], the &quot;new natural&quot; point of view is in opposition to certain established norms and philosophies.  

==Criticism==
: ''Everyone obviously has a body, humans are obviously more like apes than like robots, and obviously we all need to breathe air and drink water etc. - what's the controversy?  Things which contradict this just are not real, no matter how many papers have been written about them.''

That's a fair statement of the natural point of view.  But note that it makes an issue out of contradiction, new technologies that many seem as benevolent, and the animal nature of human beings.  And seems to require academe to clear its conclusions with [[w:ecologists]] or [[w:cognitive scientists]] or [[w:biologists]], which many would see as contradicting [[w:academic freedom]].

It is important to note that there is a continuing controversy regarding the &quot;neutral&quot; versus &quot;natural&quot; point of view, and that [[w:wikipedia]] itself seeks to avoid controversy and track the current social idea of neutrality, whether or not it is moving in favor of the &quot;natural&quot; or away from it.  If you tend to the &quot;natural point of view&quot;, be careful not to impose it on others, nor to add more than a few lines to correct articles that seem to come from a strongly anti-natural bias.  Although one could claim that any rewrite &quot;towards the natural&quot; is also &quot;more neutral&quot;, that dodges the question of audience and the political necessity of compromises.

===Ongoing controversy and editing wars===
Multiple views should be expressed as fairly as possible and labeled as such so that any remaining bias or predisposition is available to the next viewer, user, or editor attempting to use the wikipedia. [[user:mirwin]]

==Enthusiast vs. expert knowledge==
: ''I am writing articles on scientific facts and models that are not generally known outside professional circles, and which are highly politically charged. What can I do to ensure NPOV, and reduce the number of clowns who are simply destroying my articles every time they read one?''

You can't do much about careless editors. The wikipedia model does allow pretty much anyone to remove key facts, take ideological issue with a piece of what you consider to be valid science, or just remove an article. A degrading of dialogue to this point will mean warring update-bots, so we must be careful not to annoy each other quite to that point. It's a community. So in addition to bringing forth counter-arguments, you must make a case for a natural point of view by subtly highlighting consequences of defying it in favor of a &quot;more neutral&quot; but &quot;less natural&quot; view.

There is almost always a negotiation, and almost always a hidden consensus.  Even the most staunch faith groups and pure humanists, those who regard the human being as placed on Earth direct from Heaven, unable to comprehend the implications of a body or an ecology, must be accepting compromises sometimes.

A simple example: if someone was removing E=MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from physics articles, you might make note of the controversy that surrounded this theory and the lack of experimental evidence validating it &lt;b&gt;until recently&lt;/b&gt; - and then link that evidence. You might make note of the controversy that has surrounded nuclear weapons and nuclear power since their beginnings. Acknowledging these bits of history might reduce the chances that someone censors science.  

===Resolution===
: ''That isn't working. Isn't there any bottom line or sense of closure?''

Well, yes. Our modern scientific medicine tells us that if it works on a closely related primate, it's likely to work on us. Our psychology tells us that if it works on a child, it's likely to work on us until we get wise. 

A '''Neutral Point of View''' might refer directly to medicine or cognitive psychology, or even developmental psychology. But it would be hard to prove.  
Another way to look at this is to imagine, beyond '''Neutral''', that our own '''Natural Point of View''' is that of a wild body applying its own senses in a natural ecology.  

This suggests a test: If you can explain it to a four year old human child, or an ape, in a garden, using only the limited 3000-4000 word vocabulary common to such persons, you can safely assume you have achieved the neutral point of view. If not, not. Your ethical judgement is therefore required.  

===Sensitivity to other views===
: ''So, politics or ethical judgements are actually assumed in all words?''

Yes. Therefore, you are required by custom to be careful not only with your own political view, '''neutral''', '''natural''' or otherwise, but also with those of others who may be offended by your view, apparent goals, or others who they see as sharing those goals and perhaps as some kind of a 'threat'.  

Most subjects here are somewhat more complicated than the natural perspective and will assume things about body and ecology that are determined by a context (social, cultural, or otherwise). Don't be too concerned with this.  

Politics is necessary to categorization. Even choosing the names of articles is somewhat political - especially insofar as you are excluding other views, and choosing to highlight some features of a subject and simply ignore others.  

However necessary politics is, ideology is not necessary to categorization, if one is careful about detecting one's own inner conflicts and personal ethic. Start with your body. Move on to breathing, drinking water, food. You're not only building up a body, you're building up a view of an environment surrounding you, which includes both ecology - and other people.
This Are The More Inportant Topic About The Human Resorce Management.

===Objectivity===
: ''I don't have time for all that. What else can I do to get neutral?''

If there are multiple points of view starkly defined, then, lay them all out, especially on those points where they are most starkly opposed. Think like a journalist: you may not like Usama bin Laden but you'd interview him anyway.  

That example highlights the political and moral nature of the controversy:  Depending on who you are, and who or what you perceive your subject to be, you might like to shove a rifle or a microphone in their face.  We all have likes and dislikes, moral judgements, and preferred methods of dealing that have worked for us in the past.  To put yourself in a neutral state of mind, and comprehend your own natural bias, you may need to visualize something quite contrary to your own moral judgement, offending your own natural bias.

For instance, imagine you find a dead fish on a riverbank, crawling with maggots and swarming with flies.  You might initially, naturally, be inclined to vomit or depart.  Imagine, however, fighting that urge and sitting down somewhat upwind so the smell isn't overwhelming.  Concentrate on the flies.  You can deliberately decide that they are loving mothers taking care of their maggot-children in a fish-nursery.  You can deliberately decide to perceive them as something normal, natural, even caring.  You may be puking up your lunch even as you read this.  But you are capable of it.  You just did it...!

===Perspective===
: ''OK, fine, I puked but I did it.  I now understand what you're talking about, and I also see why the &quot;natural&quot; view is tough on people, and why they avoid it in favor of the &quot;neutral&quot;.  Why is this relevant to the wikipedia?''

Well, we've all got our politics.  And we've all got our own lives, which are lived out with a certain set of loyalties in a certain locality on the Earth.  [[w:Hominidae]] all share a certain set of emotions, attitudes, desires, one of which is to have some control over their environment and of course their own body.  Things which threaten that, like bacteria or warfare, are naturally going to inhibit us from thinking and writing things neutrally.

Personally, when I think hard about the money spent on nuclear weapons or particle accelerators, or technologies that threaten to wipe out all animal life and creativity on this planet, I feel much worse than I do thinking about the fly-mothers.  I'd like to simply remove a great many articles that attract attention and possibly human talent to these very destructive fields.

The point is, we all feel that way about something.  And understanding why someone devotes their life to nuclear weapons yields or the [[w:particle physics zoo]] or new ways to do [[w:biological warfare]] is essential to your ability to see and write the truth.  Someone out there thinks its valuable.

The natural point of view doesn't let you avoid that.  You have to face it, tough as that might be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up front, I'll say that this is just as valid to call &quot;the embodied point of view&quot; although that doesn't help to bridge the gap to the idea of &quot;natural law&quot;.  &quot;Embodied point of view&quot; is an enti  is a valid redirect.

This article belongs in the same name space as neutral point of view, wherever that is.

Which is probably meta.

-----

This article seems to be written as if you consider that the 'Embodied point of view' is embodied in you, [[User:24.150.61.63]]. What an ego you have! [[user:The Anome|The Anome]]

----
Yes, I do have a huge ego, and...

Yes, I should have mentioned that.  One consequence of actually attempting to *take* this point of view and *write* from it is that you come across patronizing and arrogant, and it's quite difficult to not do so.  I used to worry about this until I read Clare Graves and Don Beck's analysis that this was *ALWAYS* true of more-embodied views... specifically &quot;higher orders of conciousness always sound hierarchical, sexist, racist, to the lower value systems&quot; which are focused on simple reduction of conflict.

So, the article probably *does* have to be written that way, and it probably *does* need people like you to say that.  This is what encourages you to identify your own &quot;natural point of view&quot; or &quot;embodied point of view&quot; that we gradually summarize to reach whatever we see as &quot;neutrally natural&quot; to humans, or to [[Hominidae]], or citizens of Earth, or whatever...

Maybe we should state that articles in the meta are *not* NPOV and that it's specifically resserved for articles that *can't* be so written?  That seems a good distinction.

:While it is true that articles in the meta needs not be NPOV, although life would be better if people would try that sometimes, this is not the distinction which separates 'meta' from the encyclopedia proper.  The encyclopedia is for NPOV articles.  The talk pages on the encyclopedia are for discussion of how to get to NPOV on the article.  The meta is for discussion about the encyclopedia.  There is no place anywhere on the wikipedia domains for non-NPOV encyclopedia articles.  If you want to write a &quot;Green&quot; encyclopedia, just let me know, and I will set a wiki up for
you, at my expense, to put forward your point of view. --[[Jimbo Wales]]

------

At least you can see that you ''appear'' patronising and arrogant.  Can you also understand that there may be more than one set of opinions on an issue?  Wikipedia works on this basis.
Please write your non-NPOV stuff here, and leave the Wikipedia for encyclopedia articles: defined as NPOV reporting on what the different strands of human thinking consider to be true.  
----
The &quot;Natural Point of View&quot; article belongs in the same space as the &quot;Neutral Point of View&quot; article... actually they are both clearly meta.

:Neutral Point of View is not an encyclopedia article. It is a statement of Wikipedia policy, which the Wikipedia community generally agrees with (with various reservations). --Stephen Gilbert
::mine is just one of many reservations, obviously, but without some [[governance]] process it's pretty difficult to tell how widely shared any of them are - the project appears like it could descend to chaos without some process at least to list our [[visions]] and [[worst cases]].

Sure, there are always more than one set of opinions.  In fact I'd like to hear of a lot of other ways to assess &quot;natural&quot;... and of course they should all be metas.

A few other discussions, like &quot;reasonable method&quot; also maybe are metas...

I wish I knew &quot;what the different strands of human thinking consider to be true.&quot;  But I only know one way to find out.  Write what you think is the honest truth, balance it with the harshest criticisms you ever heard your worst enemy make, clean it up a bit so you don't seem to have multiple personality disorder, and then sit back and see who freaks out...

For about 2/3 of my articles so far, that's &quot;no one&quot;.

For another 1/6, that's one person, who either took a hand as editor or got into a collaboration that was quickly effective to produce a good article.

For the last 1/6, that's either one unsatisfiable person or multiple parties.
That's where you learn something.

But, whatever, I was the first one to say that this discussion was a meta... and now this is a meta of a meta...
----
You can add all sorts of odd and unusual articles to the wikipedia. Just make sure you employ NPOV guidelines when describing the topics. In five words, NPOV boils down to: X said Y about Z. Sticking to this format, you'll rarely go wrong.

When we start saying things like the following, it can get more difficult:
*Scientists generally agree that...
*Liberals believe that...
*Most Americans regard...

I propose that we source the sources, that is, indicated '''who says''' that scientists, liberals, or most Americans think a certain way. Sometimes attribution of the views is as controversial as the views themselves, or more so.

According to Al Gore, &quot;the science of global warming is settled&quot; (perfect NPOV).
Scientists agree that America's use fossil fuel causes global warming (would be better with a source).
*According to an article in Science magazine, scientists agree...

The latter is preferable, because it leaves room for an editor to add:
*Ten thousand scientists signed a statement disputing...

208.246.35.xxx~

----

&quot;In five words, NPOV boils down to: X said Y about Z.&quot;

This is the soul of the question.  A &quot;Natural&quot; point of view would not require every X to be able to &quot;say&quot;, nor every Y to be comprehensible in a human natural language.  Z might be something that simply can't be codified clearly... defining Z itself might be the whole issue!  There are few of these issues, but they tend to be central and controversial.  One is always at least picking one authority to name the topic in question.

----
:So, you propose that we do what, exactly?  Shall I create a program to start creating endless strings of text, in hopes of hitting upon an article Y which
accurately describes things not comprehensible in a human natural language?  But
even if I did that, then a la Cantor diagonalization, I would not have said all
that there is to say, for I would have left out real numbers that can not be stated
algorithmically nor as a fraction.

:Please speak only of things of practical import.  We are writing an encyclopedia,
and juvenile postmodernist b.s. isn't particularly helpful.

:Your comment about our not having an article on the Amazon rain forest -- now,
that's of practical import.  But the idea that we don't have articles which
express the inexpressible -- that isn't helping anyone to see how we might change.

--[[Jimbo Wales]]

One of my favourite things about the Meta site is that people are free to write things like this. More importantly though, the Meta forum means that I am also free to express my firmly held opinion that '''this entire article is one of the most ridiculous diatribes of supercillious nonsense that ever masqueraded as intelligent thought'''. Whoever wrote it is well served by maintaining anonymity, because they deserve to be laughed at and pointed to in the street. Whoever you are, you are a complete tosser. - [[MMGB]]
:thanks for the comment - at least you read it.  &quot;First they ignore you.  Then they laugh at you.  Then they fight you.  Then you win.&quot; - Gandhi

:if it's total crap, of course, one never gets past the &quot;laugh&quot; stage.

::Gandhi also left out the part about the Muslims and Hindi killing each other after you win, but that's for another article... [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]
:::Gandhi worked very hard to keep India in one piece, and was sold out by a British deal with the North-West Muslims who broke off as Pakistan and left Bangladesh on the other side of the country more or less to rot until 1970 when it split.  Notice there is little trouble between India and Bangladesh.

So, how are particle accelerators &quot;destructive technologies?&quot;  I mean, sure they can be used to inform destructive technologies, but aren't they just tools to expand our understanding of the world around us?  How is this different from calling a microscope, or even a magnifying glass for that matter, a destructive technology?</text>

Moved from [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Talk%3AVANDALISM_IN_PROGRESS Talk:VANDALISM IN PROGRESS], 2002/04/02

(Note: to link to an article on the main wikipedia, precede it with &quot;w:&quot;, as in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Epistemology]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; == [[w:Epistemology]])

Unattributed text is written by 24, who also says:

Not sure that this is the right title - someone should probably write on this issue in general.  There are 6100 million potential readers of the wikipedia, long term, and views shared near-universally by 100-300 million of them just aren't good enough to qualify as neutral point of view, if there is serious dispute about them among the other 5800-6000 million people.  Beyond that, there are certain points of view or certain focal topics that we may not wish to have represented in wikipedia at all (for instance, hate views of ethnic groups, or &quot;how to build an atom bomb in your garage&quot; or &quot;how to brew anthrax using only commercially available equipment&quot;).  These choices add up to a systemic bias, hopefully one that we choose, rather than one that we fall into by accident.


THE ORIGINAL DISCUSSION RE:  EDITORIAL CLIQUES, MATH FETISH, &quot;COMMUNITY&quot;
(still growing...)
-----
I want to register a general complaint that AxelBoldt removes and redirects articles on subjects that he simply doesn't understand, rather than fixing minor problems with them.  For instance redirecting viral_license to copyleft without even moving the material to that article or integrating it at all... just destroying it contrary to wiki's guidelines that say to fix things first.

It appears to be a personal ideological objection to trademark and patent law and perhaps other contracts that causes him to object to the general concept of a &quot;viral license&quot; - if he doubts it exists beyond copyleft, he should raise that doubt first, fix the article, etc., rather than destroy it for his own ideological reasons.

:: a quick review of his material on pornography, Sept. 11th (which I did not realize was partly his authorship when I first critiqued it), Amway, etc., turns up a fair bit of heavily slanted material written to be barely NPOV.  I expect the ideological bias goes significantly beyond the articles mentioned, but thankfully most of his material is regarding mathematics, not politics...

----
Alex is a well-known and respected member of our community, and has proven that he creates good articles.  We have a policy here of encouraging bold updates--if he thinks making a redirect makes a better article, then he should do it.  If you disagree, then you should take up your case on the talk page for that article, but don't expect the community to take your word as seriously as someone like Alex, who had contributed a great deal to this project, and clearly ''does'' know what he's talking about.  Your accusation that Alex is doing that for &quot;ideological reasons&quot; severely hurts your own credibility, because we know Alex better than that.  -- [[w:user:Lee Daniel Crocker|Lee Daniel Crocker]]

----

Bold updates are fine, but I stand by my statement.  Viral licenses are a well discussed subject regarding trademarks, e.g. Java, patents, e.g. MIT's or IBM's portfolio, services, e.g. any online service that requires non-solicitation of customers for competing services via the service itself.  They are controversial and important.  They do not reduce to &quot;copyleft&quot;.

Another such incident was breaking down &quot;intellectual property law&quot; in an economic context to 'copyright', 'patent', and 'trademark' separately when there is a clear public consensus to support such laws, and use of the term amongst lawyers.  I believe this was Axel as well, and it was equally ideological.

You may share his ideology, but the policy of denying that the subject or concept exists when it's in widespread clear use, you don't seem to share.

I repeat, on this issue, he does not know what he is talking about, and you are damaging your own credibility by supporting him.

The shared ideology of longstanding contributors can either have NO standing, or INFINITE standing.  It isn't really possible to fight a clique that uses technical means to destroy something an opposing clique is trying to do - and I believe it is proper to refer to the wikipedia standards themselves, in this case, those requesting some dialogue before simply removing new entries.

It's clear from talk:copyleft that my concern on this one topic is shared, and if a large number of intellectual property lawyers or green economists or patent and trademark agents were to show up here, it would be more widely shared.

Don't make me invite them.  Deal with your inhouse ideological problem, please.

:Wait... ''Don't''' make you invite knowledgeble people to contribute to wikipedia on subjects they're familiar with? What kind of threat is that, 24? :) [[w:user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Tuesday, April 2, 2002

:: just thought the existing clique would want to do some rewrites to fix obvious problems before a swarm of extremists showed up.  You never know, some of them will be genius, some vandals.

:* Neighbor, if there's an ideological problem here, I think you should perhaps take a good long look at the walls of that glass house you're in.   This is a community; it has established standards; you are contravening them, and then complaining that we don't do things ''your'' way. That approach has never been a productive one in any community I've ever belonged to, period. Convince us with your brilliant reasoning in talk pages, but don't attempt to (a) complain until you get what you want, (b) overawe us with your Obvious Correctness, or (c) threaten us with a mass invasion - threats are really a spectacularly bad approach to garnering consensus, you know, and as BV says, that isn't much of one. :)  

:: what absolute nonsense.  This is not a &quot;community&quot;, as the people here do not share bodily risk.  That and only that defines any 'community' I know of.  The 'established standards' are *EITHER* absolute obedience to a clique *OR* exactly and only what is established in the meta, e.g. fixing articles or critiquing in &quot;Talk&quot; if you see deeper perspective problems that are going to prevent a simple &quot;fix to NPOV&quot;.  The complaint is specific and arises only because (a) there is nowhere else to put a more general issue other than in AxelBoldt's talk page, which I did, and in many talk pages, which I also did (b) I don't claim Obvious Correctness - that is Lee Daniel Crocker's role... (c) invasion is the essence of wiki, as I see it - and I'm not threatening, I'm just telling you, if I post something on indymedia.org we'll get all kinds of people we don't necessarily want until more foundations material on the issues they care about is established... these things have to be done in an order, but if AxelBoldt is going to impose his views of oh say the Sept.11th &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, then I am obligated to warn everyone else of a shitfight to come.

:*At this time I have no position on the issue under discussion, so I'm looking at this not from an ideological stance, but simply in the ''manner'' people are handling things.  This is not &quot;The Encyclopedia According to 24,&quot; and therefore you must accept that your work ''will be edited''.  If you don't agree, give your reasoning why you think a change should be undone. Discuss. Gather opinions. Cite sources.  Deal, in other words, with the others here as if they were sensible people with a strong commitment to the best work; and chances are they will so deal with you in return. [[w:user:-- April|-- April]]

:: I can &quot;deal&quot; with literally everyone here, and only have objections to the deliberate ideological behavior of Axel Boldt which is qualitatively very different from the rest of you.

:: editing is not the problem - I have edited many many pieces to meet even bizarre objections, and generally they have improved drastically as a result.  I just raise here the question of systemic ideological bias that is not admitted or discussed anywhere.  Look, I've made clear I'm a big-G Green, and support Green Parties, and despise people like G. W. Bush and Ariel Sharon.  So what?  That doesn't prevent me from say liking Bush's education speech and quoting from it, e.g. &quot;education is a civil right&quot;, &quot;power must go out from Washington back to the people&quot;, or &quot;first responders are the key&quot; etc.  Editing isn't the issue.  It's claiming that &quot;A equals B&quot;, e.g. mutual assured destruction of Cold War &quot;is&quot; mutually assured destruction of today with biologicals, e.g. &quot;viral license&quot; &quot;is&quot; copyleft, e.g. Euler's Identity must be defined in terms of complex analysis even though Euler never knew it.

:This &quot;24&quot; guy is obviously quite educated, but on this and many other subjects his point of view is so narrow that he can't see the general public understanding of things that a general-purpose encyclopedia should cover.  It just so happens that his areas of concern are those I know something about (except for Green politics, of which I am blissfully ignorant).  In particular, he's right that among free-software advocates (which I've been among for nearly 20 years), the &quot;viral&quot; nature of the GPL as opposed to the LGPL and other licenses is a hot topic, and hasa specific nature, and probably should be written about.  But the article he wrote was useless, and far worse than merely failing to address the topic as Alex's redirect did (and I'm sure Alex did that not because of ideology, but because he clearly recognized that 24's article was very bad).  I'll see if I can placate our anonymous guest with a better article on that.  Likewise, most of the original text and structure of all of the IP articles was mine, though many others have added lots of texts.  That structure ''does'' reflect the current understanding of intellectual property law in the United States.  It may well be that there is some different understanding of the terms elsewhere, and that this ought to be covered; I welcome those who could do that well.  I should also point out that I have made no secret that my ideology is that I believe no IP law should exist; but that isn't the point of view expressed in the articles, because I'm quite capable of seeing and understanding the general consensus even if I don't agree with it.  --LDC

:: I'll say only this about &quot;the general public understanding of things&quot; - if you mean the 101 million people who voted for Gore or Bush, there are six billion others who think often-drastically otherwise.  I'm with them, not with what you seem to be getting from the media.  For instance a poll of the planet would likely reveal that 9/11 was &quot;caused by US foreign policy&quot;... is that then what the article on it should say?  Stop denying political consensus with the people who aren't here... they must be represented.  I'm certainly not the only person qualified to do that, but I am one of them.

:: to the average Chinese, &quot;viral license&quot; would be most readily understood in terms of the Chinese government's own patent pool, not any &quot;copyleft&quot;... this is a US bias at best.

:: if you agree there *should* be a viral_license article, but hate mine, then write it, but why hide my text so completely it can't be found even in &quot;talk:viral_license&quot;.  I put a new breakdown in &quot;talk:copyleft&quot;.  Alex Boldt, however, tried to shut that discussion down with a redirect that made the original text hard even to find.  If the objection is that I didn't call &quot;viral_license&quot; a &quot;stub&quot;, fine, no one would object to having &quot;this is a stub&quot; added.

:: as to IP law, it was the [[w:intellectual property law]] article itself that needed to be written, that has for now been limited to stark simple economic arguments in [[w:intellectual capital]].  That's useful as far as it goes, and does reflect the economists who write about it, but it doesn't explain how the *concept* of &quot;intellectual capital&quot; was formed from the *instruments* of intellectual property law, or the common ideological motives that caused them to become a single field of political economy, or why anyone might object ot the concept of a unifying &quot;intellectual property law&quot; - you are effectively censoring your own opinion by pretending it doesn't exist as such.  US law is probably not as important as WTO or WIPO at this point, so I note another potential bias like that behind &quot;Sept.11th Terrorist attack&quot;

Yes, there probably is a lot of American bias here.  But that's going to be hard to avoid since most of our readers and writers are Yanks.  Other points of view should certainly be covered when we know what they are--and when we can quote reliable sources for them--but I don't think it's necessarily wrong that the encyclopedia as a whole reflects the ''language'' and ''culture'' of the majority of its readers.  US law, for example, is certainly going to be covered here in more detail than foreign law, and when we do cover foreign law, in will be described using English terms and comparing it to American law.  That doesn't imply that the American point of view is better; just that it's the one our readers understand and relate to, so it serves as the baseline of the discussion.  --LDC

-----

Of the *discussion* is different than it being the baseline of the &quot;neutral point of view&quot; - I note that the Spanish group forked the wiki already... Also, much more poignantly, look at this:

&quot;Wikipedia:Unsuccessful searches (2002-04); 14:47 (1 change) . . . M [Unsuccessful search for Amazon Rainforest]&quot;

I submit that a deliberate effort must be made to put the best known descriptions of the physically real ecologically alive world here... it's quite illustrative that of 30,000 articles none of them is this one... and BTW that is not my search...

:Why don't you write an article on the subject, then? That's what most of do when we discover something we think is important is missing. [[w:user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

::I'm not complaining.  I'm pointing out that the lack of an article on such a critical-to-life subject (the Amazon rainforest is most of the biodiversity on this planet) demonstrates a serious ideological slant on the part of the wikis - i.e. you care vastly more about mathematics than biodiversity, it seems.  I'm just noting that as evidence of a clear and destructive bias, not complaining about the lack of that one article.

:Geez, you don't honestly, seriously believe that do you?  

:: yes, 

:Isn't it blindingly obvious that the reason we have lots of articles about math and none about rain forests is the same reason we have good articles on poker and none on gin?  We just happen to have a good poker player and some good mathematicians who like to contribute, and fewer gin players and biologists.  Wikipedia is still a tiny, insignificant little project in the grand scheme of things, and has only a handful of serious contributors.  I 

::thus you have a bias, an obvious and ideological one.  What's wrong with admitting you're a clique, you oldtimers?  What's the issue?

happen to think that will improve over time, but it's only been a year.  One cannot possibly infer ''anything'' from a statistical analysis of this database, because this sample is too small to be meaningful.  You'd think that would be obvious to someone who understands math fairly well.  --LDC

::: bah - you have 30,000 articles out of the intended 100,000 - 30% is far more than enough.  If the most important living things in the world, those being the Amazon and Congo rainforest basins, have no standing or identity at the point the database is 30% complete, they never will, without a radical shift in direction and priority.  I am the first step towards that deluge.

:::What &quot;clear and destructive bias&quot;? Not everyone is expert or interested in your particular pet subjects, even if your pet subjects are very important to you. Wikipedia is still young, and a web site like this seems likely to disproportionately attract the technically inclined -- who may well care more about math than biodiversity -- at first. Don't like it? Invite people who '''do''' know about biodiversity to join in and write about it. That's the whole point of this project! [[w:user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

::::biodiversity begins in your gut, where it takes 13 species of bacteria to keep you alive.  This is not a &quot;pet&quot; subject - rather, you are yourself a &quot;pet&quot; of this subject.

:::::(Clap clap clap) And those 13 species of bacteria couldn't live if their little cytoplasm-filled bodies weren't regulated by chemical interactions, which on a smaller scale are regulated by molecular physics, which has a little something to do with mathematics. What's your point here, exactly? [[w:user:Brion VIBBER]]

::::::what if I don't agree that molecular physics regulates those chemical interactions, but that other chemical interactions, notably those happening in your cognitive system, are causing certain experimental outcomes when you go poking around into physical interactions?  My point here is that &quot;we&quot; are way more sure that the 13 species of bacteria are there doing something that we don't fully understand, than we are about anything between the cellular and chemical levels, and more certain of the chemical than the physics that (supposedly) underlies that.  It's entirely reasonable to start with the chemistry of the cell and cognitive system, work from that as a neutral point of view, and then work up to a description of &quot;the thing that believes in molecular physics&quot;... see [[w:particle physics foundation ontology]] for more on this.  The big point is, [[w:foundation ontology]] is a big part of systemic bias.  Your belief that one level is regulated by a lower level is a bias called [[w:reductionism]]... your belief that mathematics describes it well enough to be understood by us on this cognitive level is probably [[w:meme totalism]].  Both of which tend to be common in encyclopedia authors... yet another bias, this one arising from [[w:self-selection]].

::::I'll go one step further and point out what should be obvious, i.e. that even people who care deeply about a subject may not always start an article on it.  Similarly, some topics are more difficult to write about correctly than others--we had an article on [[w:ambergris]] before one on [[w:whales]]; is that necessarily indicative of an ideological bias?  Hang out awhile and get a feel for the place, &amp;amp; don't be so quick on the judgements.  [[w:user:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]

:::::I am not writing on subjects I am not already, in my own best judgement, one of the top 100 compilers of research in the world.  That's why I don't write, for instance, an Amazon Rainforest article, but I do write about [[w:capitalism]] and the [[w:anti-globalization movement]].  Compare those two with any other articles ever written on either subject, of similar length.  They will stand up.

Anyone interested in a non-US point of view should check out http://indymedia.org where many such views are presented, usually in English.  It's hardly neutral but it's a start to understanding how these topics are viewed by people with radically different assumptions than most US Republicans and Democrats.

Anyway, this is now about neutral point of view, not about &quot;vandalism&quot;, if you believe that Axel Boldt acts in general from an honest desire to improve wikipedia rather than a deliberate attempt to impose a certain view (common in the US) on articles that are trying to veer deliberately away from it, then fine, that issue should no longer be discussed here but rather in meta.

:Oh, fer Pete's sake, 24.  (and why don't you just get yourself a user name and sign in? ).  Yes, there is a certain US bias and yes, it's deplorable -- at least in my book.  But that is simply because there are 1) more US Americans than any other group contributing, and; 2) lots of those US American wikipedians don't seem to be aware that this is the English-language (including the UK, Ireland, Canada, Oz, NZ wikipedia) -- or, they don't know enough to comment on the English-speaking world outside their own little corner.  It's not some kind of conspiracy.  Until more non USAmericans contribute, there will probably be some bias.  As for Axel, um....he's GERMAN!!!! He just lives in the US.  And, as others have mentioned, he's earned the trust of the community -- which we are, thanks very much.  We do share a risk, in that we publicly put our names to a project that can be vetted by anyone.  Since many of us are academics, we do have a stake in making sure that the site isn't full of garbage.  Finally, I can't see why you think there's a bias -- the articles merely reflect the expertise (real or imagined) or favorite topics of the community members.  I am very interested in things ecological, but I'm an historian -- For that reason, I write and edit more in the humanities, partially because I fiugure there are others more qualified to discuss life science-y things.  If you want more of them, either write them yourself or get someone you know to do it.  And please stop complaining that a mathemetician writes about math. [[w:user:J Hofmann Kemp|J Hofmann Kemp]]

:: never complained about the man's math, nor his politics for that matter.  It's his assumption of point of view, on issues that widely debated by folks ideologically opposite.  We all do our best to keep &quot;garbage&quot; out of the site, but frankly, using &quot;terrorist attack&quot; in a title is an example of garbage.  And again, I'm not complaining about lack of an Amazon Rainforest article - I am noting it as evidence of a specific pro-math anti-ecology *interest* or *awareness* slant... not even a bias... just shows that the interests don't reflect any objectively-real reality.  As to &quot;community&quot;, a community is people who share bodily risk, and any other definition kills living things, and I will have no part of it.

:Hmm.  Very odd that you should not want to be part of a community of people whose shared goal is to produce a product that replaces one traditionally produced by killing trees, but that's certainly a choice.  But to hold the point of view that such a group of people, with common interests and goals, working together to achieve them, does not constitute a &quot;community&quot; in the perfectly ordinary English usage of the word is not a point of view that deserves to be taken seriously.  --LDC

:: killing trees from tree farms is far less a sin than killing them from rainforest basins.  When you understand that, I've broken the cycle of destruction by commodification... if only in your own mind, LDC.


:: The word &quot;community&quot; originates to describe people who shared bodily risk.  If we abuse the term by applying it, as in &quot;virtual community&quot;, to a group of people who only share opinion or vocabulary or ideology, we will be certain to lose all of its original meaning to describe people who share bodily risk - there are probably 100,000 different ways to form a pseudo-community or virtual-community, and only one way to form a real community... so if you give them equal weight in your definitions you destroy all real community.  My opinion is that it wont happen, because everyone who mistakes false community for real community will have their throat cut while sleeping at some point in the next 40 or 50 years as a matter of moral and survival necessity on the part of members of real communities protecting against conspiracies calling themselves &quot;communities&quot; which aren't.  So, you may take that as seriously as the view that one is morally liable for the bodily survival of the people harmed by one's actions at a distance.  

:: but never mind my opinion, abuse of the term &quot;community&quot; to mean simple tribes or parties sharing an opinion or action with no bodily risk involved, is probably vandalism only from my point of view.  And, perhaps, that of the [[w:Vandals]], who recognized the Roman concept of community based on submission to Emperor as absolutely false and corrupt, and slaughtered the Romans for it in huge numbers.  Now *THAT* is &quot;Vandalism in progress&quot;.  Sleep well...
  
** * Sigh... http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=community ... 24, you don't get to be the sole arbiter of words, either. And if you don't like all those American dictionaries, try the OED - but I warn you, you won't get any more joy there. 

:: no, it's not ridiculous to hold words to their original meanings when all variance from those meanings creates horrendous ecological and bodily harm - imagine what would happen if I were to self-servingly redefine &quot;violence&quot; for instance... anyway, I happen to think English needs an academie like francais and that English is losing its global influence for lack of any control at all over official use of words.  It rapidly becomes a language useful only for lying.

:: Dictionaries are allowed to be wrong.  They can render words worthless or meaningless that way.  I'm asking you to contemplate, as an individual, the impact of the term &quot;community&quot; being used to mean something other than a group that shares common bodily risk... does it or does it not become useless for that purpose if it is allowed to have any other more ideological purpose?

** * That seems to me to be the probem you've been having here in a nutshell - like Humpty Dumpty in [[w:Through the Looking-Glass]], you have your own ideosyncratic uses of words, and you're upset when anyone uses a different definition than your own. The trouble is that language gains its ''entire meaning'' from the ''collective agreement'' on the uses of words; trying to 

:: if that were so, linguistic diversity would not mirror ecological diversity - see [[w:bioregional democracy]]'s linguistic references, please.  language does not gain its meaning from agreement - but rather, from action.

* co-opt language itself is, frankly, a little ridiculous, as you'll end up talking only to yourself. Dictionaries - and encyclopediae - define and discuss words and prhases ''in terms of their common usage'', and that is explicitly stated on Wikipedia (see [[w:wikipedia: Naming conventions]]).  I 

:: I'm not digging around for false uses of community in others' articles.  Nor am I shoving quotes around &quot;[[w:terrorist]]&quot; in other people's articles.  In the long run, my strict usage will prevail, because it is provably right.  To prove that, I will write many articles this way, and my insistence on these definitions will eventually convince others it's the *only* way.

sympathize with your desire to make your viewpoint a larger part of Wikipedia, I really do. '''However''', it must be done as a give-and-take rather than this sort of automatic assumption that a redirect  is an attempt at ideological sabotage, for heaven's sake. I repeat, if you consider that 

:: the assumption was not &quot;automatic&quot;, Axel was demonstrating a clear ideological slant that you can read in all of his non-math articles... I don't begrudge him his opinion.  I do begrudge not checking references.

Wikipedia is a collective effort, with a broad spectrum of opinions and knowledge bases; and if you respect it as such, and its fellow members, the discussions are far more likely to be fruitful - and, not incidentally, to 

:: the discussions *aren't* fruitful - they are at best a source of fertilizer.

include and expand on more topics in which you have an interest.  If you continue to maintain a confrontational approach, my personal opinion is that you'll just end up creating a lot of bad feeling - and bad articles.  [[w:user:-- April|-- April]]

:: so far, confrontation on the key issues of what constitutes neutral point of view has improved articles, mine and that of others.  Anyway, we've stated our own respective views on what vandalism is, and are now heavily into the point of view questions.  This entire chunk of dialogue should be elsewhere.

:April, you beat me to the comments.  The ideosyncratic definition of &quot;community&quot; used by 24 seems to fit into the category of Over-narrow definition in the article [[w:Fallacies of definition]]. [[w:user:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]]

:: I believe I have the right to use an over-narrow definition, and wait for others to adopt it.  And to keep removing text that tries to generalize what I say overmuch... much as others objected to (what they considered to be) my inventing subjects into existence by assuming too much about their connection.

:::24, you have the right to use any definition that you want, but it doesn't make that usage anything more than archaic.  The time has long passed when ''community'', or even ''communitas, -tatis'' meant a group sharing bodily risk.  That meaning had changed before Rome fell.  Neither did the Vandals slaughter Romans because of some overwhelming compulsion to rage against the Roman machine, as it were.  Your interpretation of the interaction between that particular Germanic people and the Romans is &quot;interesting&quot; at best -- and certainly not accurate.  Please don't twist historical fact to try to prove a point.  At any rate, I think that most of us here are in agreement that we do constitute a community.  Moreover, your denial that a community in fact exists would seem to imply your unwillingness to be part of that community.  If that be the case, than perhaps, as a deliberate outsider, you could explain why it matters what Axel's alleged biases are?[[w:user:J Hofmann Kemp]]

:::: the bias matters only because it moves wiki in the direction of an elite clique of believers in meaning assigned by some top-down process... serving a particular view of life that only serves a rather small minority, but has a rather drastically overweighted representation here on wiki - the math vs. rainforest question being only one of many.  Lots of concern about &quot;child pornography&quot; because of faux views of safety - none about families cut off from aid in Western Afghanistan selling *their* children for a dollar each... to whom?  for what?  think about it.  Is that worse or better than suicide bombing?  Community arises from *those* choices, or fails because there are those who believe that other decisions are equally important... &quot;academics&quot;. hm.

:::: hang out, have a beer, become a community subject to the same suicide bombers or dirty copshops any time or anywhere you want.  Or, alternatively, offend the same military intelligence agencies and likewise become a real community.  Vandals, suicide bombers, etc., are merely a means to that end...

:::: &quot;denial that a community in fact exists would seem to imply your unwillingness to be part of that community&quot; - more or less right, and one reason why I don't get involved in the reputation gaming of the academics.  I can seek *collaborators* here - but *community*?  No, that comes from freezing weather and no adequate cover, it comes from tear gas, it comes from living on a couple bucks a day and making new friends in the soup kitchens eating the same scary food.  For wikipedia to represent the point of view of the billion people who live on a dollar a day, or the two billion who live on two dollars a day, or even some kind of median line, it's got a long way to go.

*** Just one more note, 24: I've thought about that a good deal myself. But I also don't pretend that ''I'' truly know what it is to live on a dollar a day - and neither, I suspect, do you. That's the bitter truth. You and I can ''sympathize'' and ''empathize'' with those who do - but if we grant that, we must also grant that so can anyone else. It's just the way it works.  As for being sure that your definition will be accepted as the One True Way someday... that way lies fanaticism, and I strongly advise that you reconsider that attitude.  For one thing, it's not in accordance with the Green pillar of &quot;decentralized democracy,&quot; in which everyone's input matters.  (You seem to be implying that only input which agrees with you matters, which rather misses the point.)   For another, it is, don't you think, a bit arrogant for you to claim to speak for many billions of people, including people of the future?  I admit this is a pit of arrogance I've fallen into myself on many occasions; all the more reason for me to point that particular pit out to others, that they may be spared the bruises to the ego that invariably result.  [[w:-- April]]

::: I know exactly what it is to live on a dollar a day, but not in the middle of a desert admittedly.  I also know what it's like to have no phone and no electricity for a year, albeit in the middle of a city.  That likely puts me a little closer to the perspective of the billions than you - but of course I am still interested in listening insofar as you have some way to tell when I understand something better than you.  Else, why bother?  The key advantage of a decentralized democracy is ignoring people on the other side of the Continental Divide.  Avoiding groupthink is ultimately what matters...

::and from me again, 24 -- It's possible that you need to deal with the fact that, by its very medium of communication, i.e., the internet, Wikipedia is arguably elitist -- its readers and contributors are those fortunate enough to have computer and internet access.  It's also very much a reflection of the interests of community members -- and hardly a uniform reflection.  

:::absolutely true.  It's definitely fighting uphill and pissing into the wind.  But so was giving up electricity for a year.

Personally, I think the 50 or so articles devoted to ''Atlas Shrugged'' is obsessive and ridiculous -- but somebody else thinks a cliif-notes type treatment is useful.  That's one of the downsides, but something I'm happy to live with in order to have the freedom to write on obscure historical stuff.  

:::these anal documenters of Rand type people just prove they are stupid, and somewhat amoral, even evil.  So what?  I understand Rand better than they do, what more is there to know?

I agree that there are many meaty topics that could and probably should be dealt with here -- but I also believe that many of those topics fall into the realm of current events (not really encyclopedic) or are too big to tackle within the time constraints of many Wikipedians.  Most of us write what we

know (and some of us write odd, not really encyclopedic articles to push a particular agenda).  The former is pretty understandable -- the latter often results in a waste of time for the folks trying to neutralize non-NPOV diatribes, and may be a contributory factor as to why &quot;important&quot; stuff isn't covered.  It could also be that the experts in the &quot;important&quot; stuff are too damned busy trying to effect change rather than dink around on an open content encyclopedia.  

::: likely - but perhaps they should pay more attention to the fact that there are 50 idiotic Ayn Rand diatribes and 0 articles on Amazon Rainforest.  I am not interested in others &quot;pushing an agenda&quot; - for myself I reveal my beliefs and then I write as neutrally as I can about things relevant to that, or more importantly relevant to others' reactionary responses to that... since I am close enough to correct to begin with, all sane people eventually settle on some version of events with me.  And the insane reveal themselves.

And by the way, 24...from my desk, it seems just a tad hypocritical for you to make suggestions about what &quot;we&quot; should do with the Pedia and to deny that it forms a type of community (a &quot;we&quot; kind of thing), when you don't have the manners to introduce yourself to the community you would apparently like to lead while not being a member.

These are unnecessary to the project of neutralizing the gollums (who are at present allowed to run roughshod over bodies with promotions of filth like AI and transhumanism and nanotechnology, projects which even some promoters believe will kill a billion people in our lifetimes - short as those may be).

It remains to be see if people here wish to find the actual median of global human opinion, write specifically for lower-vocabulary speakers of English as a Second Language on some topics, stop asserting that physics or mathematics mean more than ethics or morality in determining the &quot;reality&quot; of our lives, etc. - I can make life somewhat more annoying for those who assert this crap which destroys [[w:biodiversity]], [[w:indigenous peoples]], [[w:Great Apes]] and the like.

Another serious problem in systemic bias of wikipedia is that women are under-represented - most of the world's seriously useful knowledge is in poor mothers of children who are forced to be ingenious.  Right now wiki is of no use to them at all.  That must change.

You can be anonymous. That's okay. I like signing in. To each his own.

:that diversity is important - critical, even, to breaking up [[w:groupthink]].

But can't you be a little more cooperative? I have engaged in contentious debate myself, and it never got me anywhere. (Right, Dr. Kemp?)

:cooperate *WITH WHAT*?  There is no governing process, no ethical framework other than sketched here in meta, and one pedant (LDC) and one math fetishist (Axel Boldt) taking it on themselves to &quot;correct&quot; many things they have no way to comprehend because they are pushing a political ideological agenda... if not a personal [[w:cosmology]].  Meanwhile cutting out all mentions of other personal cosmology, e.g. that of [[w:Paul Erdos]], that drastically and permanently altered the sciences and mathematics that they claim to comprehend.  They invent double and triple standards and ignore the concerns of the [[three billionth user]].  These seem to be unethical, ignorant, perhaps even dangerous people, whose main political method is telling other people they are worthless, and their elimination from the project seems like the only path right now.  They may grow up, but if they haven't by now, I doubt they will. - 24

You obviously have a wealth of knowledge. I encourage you to share it. 

:there's lots I *don't* share, and certainly some I wouldn't share with people like this.

But I ask you to consider what the other contributors want from you.

Personally, all I want is for you to remember to attribute sources.

:X said Y about Z.

::This i have done wherever and whenever i deem a notion controversial.  my judgement of this is very very good, and much much better than that of my opponents.  Obviously there must be bridge text which must summarize things from the sources - and obviously we don't all trust each other to write that - so cliques will form.  That's inevitable, and fine.  When one emerges, such as LDC and Axel Boldt have chosen to form, an opposition must form to that to defefat them, else the project will be destroyed.  If you would like to form an opposition party to them, fine, understand [[threats]] and [[visions]] a bit, figure out what you really want and don't want, and then write a [[status quo]] report and see who is most aligned with your point of view...

In talk pages, please don't make '''the same mistake I have repeatedly made:''' which is, to tell people they are wrong. It hurts their feelings, whether they'll admit it or not. It makes them defensive and less sympathetic to you.

:fuck their feelings, and fuck mine.  Fuck sympathy too.  This is NOT A COMMUNITY - a community is people subject to the same potentials of [[w:bodily harm]].  This is at best a fierce adversarial process where we find and weed out those who don't follow certain ethical rules (like uniform standards, respecting factional language where the faction makes some key distinctions, not pretending subjects or critiques don't exist, using lack of net discourse under a certain name as &quot;proof&quot; that 10000 other names that are all controversial are somehow 10000 topics), and other typical tricks to break up opponents arguments, waste their energy, wear them down, adn drive them out.  What these people need is a little suicide bombing in their midst, and that's exactly what will happen (metaphorically).  It's not a mistake, it's war, and that's exactly how they want it. 

Try saying things like:
*There's another way of looking at that.
*Members of organization P believe Q about R.
*A thinks that B's point of view is an example of C.

Granted, it's easier for me to give this advice to you than to follow it myself. But it's still good advice, isn't it?

:not really.  Meme totalists cannot be dealt with, only psychologically attacked and destroyed.  There is no political process they acknowledge, thus no point in debate.  Look, in the two minutes it takes me to type this, four or five kids died in the [[w:developing nations]], and probably by the time I deal with today's sabotage another [[w:Great Ape]] will have been shot too.  If I was God, I'd lightning-bolt the walking garbage that funds particle accelerators, plays golf, and divides the language up into meaninglessness so that English is only good for fraud.  But I'm not, I'm just one more voice, and I'm going to beat these people.  My moral rationale is simple, and my political process is clear:  [[three billionth user]] concerns drive everything I do and say.  If you think I'm a problem, follow the method in [[status quo]].  So far that is the only governing procedure that wiki has...

I look forward to reading more of your contributions.

:you will - and when the Cultists have quit sabotaging the project and gone away to commit suicide by downloading or Friendly AI or whatever, you will see more value out of them than you ever imagined.  Godspeed, and thank you.

Thank you.

Ed Poor

Well. Since 24 believes that tact and consideration are unnecessary, let me dispense with them for the moment with respect to him/her/it/them. 

:thank you for not wasting our time.  and for respecting my inner diversity.

'''24, you are a raging hypocrite.''' Ideosyncracy is if anything a benefit, in my view, but hypocracy and an attitude that borders on the sociopathic are definitely not. 

:sociopathic is preferable to body-pathic.  And body-pathic is preferable to ecopathic.  So you are joining the political party of Axel Boldt and LDC?  Good to know.  Consider me one of your [[worst cases]] and fill your view of these awful things (ideosyncratic, hypocritic, sociopathic) attitudes there.  You can't put it in [[threats]] since it has, in your view, already happened at least once.

In claiming to be primarily concerned for others, you've shown no concern for anyone but yourself. Your actions (&quot;You are NOT a community because you don't fit MY PERSONAL definition of one!&quot;) 

:your view is wrong, and will be crushed.  That is not personal.  Those who see community only in shared risk of bodily harm will have far greater cohesion under social pressure than those who believe it due to abstraction, and accordingly will win out militarily.  It is entirely up to you whether you choose to be crushed with this view or not, just as any Roman could have gone and joined the &quot;Barbarians&quot;.

are in total contradiction to the mores you claim to support.  You choose

:what &quot;mores&quot;?  Mores in the sense of the original Greek &quot;customs&quot;?  Or in the modern sense of the guiding core aesthetic that is personal to each of us?  If it's the Greek, can I come bugger your children too?  Now who's the hypocrite?

confrontation over cooperation - so much for pacifism ''and'' democracy. You 

: nonsense.  There was no political process to govern the wiki before I came, and I have laid out a very neutral one in [[status quo]] that has only persuasive power and no censorship.  Follow it or fix it, but don't pretend you can fix it until you've added one each to [[best cases]], [[worst cases]], [[visions]] and [[threats]] please.  That would be cooperation, and since there is no way for me to kill you from here, that is also pacifism.  The &quot;democracy&quot; will follow once you admit that there is a need for parties.

present your opinions as factual, but turn around and accuse everyone else of being partisan. You remind me of those who claim that &quot;religious persecution&quot; means &quot;taking away my right to force everyone else to follow my religion&quot;.   

:wholly depends on definition of &quot;force&quot;.  scream at them all you want, destroy their self esteem by political means, convince them to suicide bomb your own worst enemy, whatever.  But none of this satisfies my definition of &quot;force&quot; which applies only to the ones who use the power of physics and mathematics and chemistry, e.g. to make the bombs, to make the computers.

This project attracts attention and interest ''because'' of its stated principles, as on meta and the articles on policy and NPOV. 

:nonsense.  It's in spite of them, and the hypocritical lack of attention to the contradictions between them.  NPOV is obvious non-policy, there must be bridging text, and so it applies only to controversial claims.  Who decides what is &quot;controversial&quot;?  A ruling clique... subject to its own groupthink.  Read [[Natural point of view]] and [[three billionth user]] and then tell me that these are not better guidelines than the current crap about &quot;neutral&quot;... abused daily especially by LDC.

In the ''extremely'' unlikely event that we were to allow you to take its 
development off in the direction you choose, it would lose the very thing 





:there is no &quot;we&quot;, remember?  You are part of the party claiming *not* to be imposing an ideology.  You can't admit that you are.

that makes it valuable - its appeal as a compendium of generalized information. 

:there is no such thing as &quot;a compendium of generalized information&quot;.  What distinguishes information from data is that it is used to make a decision... what decision does the current &quot;[[w:meme]]&quot; article enable?  I'm all ears.

Do recall that this ''is'' inteded for the portion of the world that (a) speaks English 

:with what [[vocabulary]]?

and (b) has access to a computer, 

:with what bandwidth, frequency, and print capacity (to read offline)?  this is laid out with other questions in [[three billionth user]]

and spare us your diatribes about the &quot;three billionth person,&quot; who quite  likely has neither. 

:apparently the one billionth person already does.  And if there is not to be another fork of wiki's content doing a better job making it useful to that one billionth person, then the &quot;editorial board&quot; here is quite irrelevant and I will replace it with another meta-structure that works.  But, for now, I am still willing to educate extremely unethical &quot;people&quot; such as yourself who are mistaking &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;civilization&quot; for &quot;value&quot;.

Also kindly recall that as we ''do'' get more communities represented on the Internet, they themselves will be adding to this work. To put it bluntly, 

:the &quot;communities&quot; who are &quot;represented&quot; (good word, and note the parallel to politics and representative democracy) cannot &quot;add to&quot; work that is written in overly complex language with deliberate disrespect for their [[w:cosmology]] and [[w:foundation ontology]].  Be as Eurocentric or US-centric or huge-English-dictionary-centric as you want, and create a clique with a pet database of clique terms... but that is not useful in any way to anyone.

24: &quot;the people&quot; don't need you to speak for them. They're capable of speaking for themselves, 

:several classes of people apparently do - [[w:Great Apes]], those in [[w:developing nations]] without much net access or English [[vocabulary]], and even those [[w:anti-globalization movement]] types who don't participate in net or [[w:Global Greens]] top-down games.  If they come here and say anything, they will soon be driven away by LDC, Axel Boldt, yourself, and other white trash.

and I consider it unbearably patronizing for you to presume yourself a messianistic figure preaching the Truth to all other benighted mortals. Grow up.

:I am the adult here.  you are the child.  When you comprehend that, we can talk more seriously.

There you go, 24. All truth (as I see it), no sympathy. Can you deal with it, or do your rules only apply to you - hypocrite?  [[user:-- April|-- April]]

:the rules are laid out in [[status quo]] and [[three billionth user]] - as *QUESTIONS* - which is how all effective ethical rules are always structure.

----
So, we have one [[w:political party]] composed of April, Axel Boldt, and LDC - Olof and others may also identify with that party.  Do we have another, yet?

A [[w:two-party system]] is a good place to start, to address this clear bias.

----
Nice try, but no cigar, 24. More likely, all that will happen is that you will be ignored. 

:by you, likely.  But you are irrelevant.  There are billions more &quot;of me&quot; than &quot;of you&quot;, and it won't take much to get hundreds of them here.  It never has.

Since you cannot seem to manage dialogue, much preferring monologue (not to 

:you don't seem to know what &quot;dialogue&quot; is - to you and others of your party, it seems that truth flows directly from a [[w:particle accelerator]] into the [[w:Standard Model]] leading to a [[w:Theory of Everything]] and thence the [[w:Singularity]].  Your linear view of reality imposes monoculture and thus monologue is all you know.  You have abandoned many attempts at real dialogue.

mention the racist epithet above), attempting to conduct a dialogue with you is clearly a waste of my time - time that could better be spent working on the Wikipedia. If your view of taking over the Wikipedia and turning it to your own ends makes you happy, 24, I wish you joy of it; but I want no part of it.

:I have no such view.  I laid out the [[threats]], [[visions]], [[best cases]] and [[worst cases]] and [[value system]] files, and they are growing - slowly for now.  Sooner or later someone will assess the [[status quo]].  My view is not of &quot;taking over the wikipedia&quot; myself but finding that common ground.  I do not &quot;turn it to my own ends&quot; but to that of the [[three billionth user]].  

''My'' view of the future is that those who dance around screaming &quot;my way, ''my'' way!&quot; will be left to dance and scream by themselves, while the 

:certainly so.  there is nothing original in any of what I have added here.  As I have said before, when it's original, you'll know it.

rest of us are working out productive approaches to a mutually respectful society in the long run, and leave the egotists behind to scream their egos out to the void. Enjoy. [[user:-- April|-- April]]

:no, you are working out the destruction of the planet and its peoples... the furthest thing from &quot;mutually respectful&quot;, but likely &quot;productive&quot; in your sick linear measuring scheme of law, science, economics, and the wikipedia all as ends in themselves.

:egos are for those who deserve them - those who use them to serve other living things - 24
----
24: your behavior has been brought to my attention, and I still care about Wikipedia.  So I just want to weigh in as follows: if you continue to disrupt the Wikipedia community, it will unfortunately have no choice but to ban you.  Wikipedians have already agreed (long before you arrived on the scene) to respect the neutral point of view and to ''work together'' on articles.  I've been reading (just now) instances of your failure to understand or respect this policy.  It's also amazing that you say that Wikipedia isn't a community.  You certainly are behaving as if you believe it isn't one. --[[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]

Reply by 24: your behavior has been brought to my attention, and I still care about Wikipedia.  So I just want to weigh in as follows: if you continue to disrupt the Wikipedia community, 
:there is no &quot;community&quot; - a community is people who share [[w:risk]] of [[w:bodily harm]].  I am hardly threatening to suicide bomb you - if I was, you would become a &quot;community&quot; under that threat.  An encyclopedia is a market in theories and facts, more or less, with obvious uniform transactions.  I submit that you are not assessing what is going on but rather reacting to some people's assertions that I am hurting their feelings.  You should review some of the variosu types of abuse and strange accusations heaped on me, especially from LDC and Axel (although the latter has settled down somewhat).

it will unfortunately have no choice but to ban you. 
:how does &quot;it&quot; make this decision.  What does it think is &quot;choice&quot;?  How is a ban proposed and carried out?  under what system of [[governance]]?

Wikipedians have already agreed (long before you arrived on the scene) to respect the neutral point of view and to ''work together'' on articles.  
:I've done that on many articles already.  Given the high degree of scrutiny my work is under, I'd say I've done that on far far more articles than anyone else here.  Also, I've deliberately chosen topics that are controversial and divisive.  Thus, I have become associated with the controversy of those topics.

I've been reading (just now) instances of your failure to understand or respect this policy.  
:I understand it completely.  Certainly I made mistakes early on, but am getting the hang of it.  NPOV as you define it is a good description of how a group of people sharing a bias can equalize that bias into a single common bias.  It is a useless and terrible description of how the output comes to be useful to any reader - how it is relevant to the survival or thriving of their body, their choice of action.  In these respects, it shares the same &quot;bodyless&quot; flawed assumptions of the &quot;free software&quot; crowd, which is to say, that somehow access to hardware and ability to read complex source code and be trusted to change it, is the same as knowing what it should do.  That flawed assumption, which is even worse in the 'open source' crowd, has caused many of those projects to die.  You are making that assumption here, which is unsurprising, but i would think you should care at least to define a means of [[governance]] that serves the [[three billionth user]].

It's also amazing that you say that Wikipedia isn't a community.  You certainly are behaving as if you believe it isn't one. --[[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]
:How would that be &quot;amazing&quot;?  I say it isn't, I behave as if it isn't, I respect formal or rigorous structure, I ignore a few irrelevant complaints, I deal with many relevant ones.  That's a process called &quot;business&quot;.  It relies on efficient logistics - not pleasing people who can't be pleased. It cannot work without [[governance]].  It remains only for you to say what that is.  If the governance is &quot;dictatorship by clique well-known to each other&quot;, fine, that is standard [[w:groupthink]] and standard [[w:monarchy]] and standard [[w:military fiat]].  Well known paradigms.  And not amenable to producing good intellectual work.

:I request that you read this entire file.  I stated my own view of how the world works in [[Natural point of view]], so that others could attack me for it or check my articles for biases arising from it.  They have, and they do.  There is no inherent contradiction between your &quot;Neutral&quot; and my &quot;Natural&quot; - although we differ on how much attribution any given view might required, that arises and is settled file per file.  Accordingly, even very controversial topics are managing to get covered now.  Eventually, we will even get around to that all-important [[Amazon rainforest]].

:you are, of course, entitled to close ranks and ban.  But you will not find a more determined representative of the actual end users you claim to wish to serve than myself.  I stand outside this &quot;community&quot; that thinks it is somehow a fair arbiter of the truth, where citations are required, where not, etc.  I suggest you read my article on [[w:ontology]] which contrasts a bit with yours.  We may find some common ground there.  Frankly I find this attempt to assign common meaning to the English verb &quot;to be&quot; to be beyond absurd, and my rewrite was much more concerned with the way we do that in our real lives... if you would work on that one file with me, perhaps you would see the issue.

:if not, well, take the easy way out, and when 10000 more of me show up and overwhelm your system of non-governance, don't count on me to bail you out.  This is the only chance you get to see that NPOV is not enough, you need goals and a [[w:foundation ontology]] of your own.

:Godspeed, 24.
----
One could easily have expected you to reply like this, of course.  But you are not understanding something: my comment was not an argument for you to reply to sentence-by-sentence, as if, in the game you are playing, you score points by refuting as many sentences as possible.  Nope, I was giving you advice, or making a request.  If you refuse, so be it. --[[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]
----
It's amazing how the very best historical analogue to pomo deconstructionists like 24 is the medieval theosophists who filled volumes about those miniature dancing angels. It's reminiscent of the way opposite radical ideaologies like Communism and Fascism ended up having more in common than not. But instead of endless para-analysis of unseen spiritual entities, 24 and friends attempt to invalidate the very currency of communication: language. Wikipedia ''is'' a community, 9/11 ''was'' terrorism, biodiversity ''is'' important but doesn't trump everything else. The beautiful thing is, by his own ontological rules, 24 can claim no more objective basis upon which to dismiss my definitions than he must grant me to dismiss his. -- [[user:JDG|JDG]] 6 Oct. 2002

24: You so funny!

Nein. Was ist? Himmelpharber?

----
I'm still waiting for someone to come up with a real definition of &quot;neutral point of view&quot; that isn't just &quot;because we say it is&quot;. It seems like there are roving bands of Orwellian truth monitors enforcing a left wing orthodoxy here. The systemic bias I see isn't just in what IS said in wikipedia articles, but what ISN'T said. Minority views are expunged, suppressed from history by militants intent on enforcing their idea of what &quot;neutral&quot; is. Whole pages are voted for deletion by people who want to suppress the information those pages communicate. Deleters don't even give editors time to put together a decent article before they descend en masse to make the editor conform to the left orthodoxy or be depersonated out of wikipedia. 

There would be much less strife in wikipedia if different factions were allowed to post their view of what &quot;neutral&quot; is for a given topic, and the reading public was allowed to rate articles. Particularly for topics that are generally in dispute in the world at large, either politically or with regard to other things, the idea of reaching consensus in wikipedia on a topic when there is no consensus in the world at large smacks of elitist arrogance and pretentions to tyranthood.

The best way to deal with trolls in a free Internet environment (like Usenet--or wiki) is to ignore them.  [http://www.firelily.com/support/depression/trolls.html Please] -- [http://members.aol.com/intwg/trolls.htm do] -- [http://members.tripod.com/~thewebtvguru/trolls/ not] -- [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Internet_troll respond] -- [http://www.topfloor.com/pr/communities/ch3.htm to] -- [http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/troll.html trolls] -- just undo his changes, if necessary.  But don't respond.  I apologize for not having kept that in mind myself.  I could have saved myself a lot of grief had I kept that simple advice in mind. --[[user:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]
::Larry, (if you ever see this) this was silly - how do you know who is a troll if you dont talk to them? The &quot;ignorance approach&quot; is loaded with problems, among them the tendency to treat trolls like vandals instead of turning them into contributors. -[[User:Stevertigo|Stevertigo]] 23:38, 28 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:::Larry, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;trolls&quot;.  Presumably these &quot;trolls&quot; are humans, just like you and me.  Ignoring them, and deleting everything that they say (regardless of the content) seems a little silly.  Surely it is better to judge text by the value of the contribution, not the value of the contributor.

This is a response from [[Jimbo Wales]] to 24. &quot;24&quot; is the nickname used for [[w:user:24.150.61.63]]; do not confuse him/her/it with 24.28.xxx.xxx who is also active on the site.
:I recommend that people ''stop'' responding to 24. Reading over the various exchanges, it is quite clear that he is not interested in understanding what others are saying, nor the goals of Wikipedia. 
::that's clearly untrue - I've responded to a great many specific concerns and have never refused any dialogue with anyone - merely their ideology - it is, rather, the various people attacking me who are not interested in understanding what &quot;others are saying&quot; outside the doors of this project and certain narrow academic subfields - 24

:Since he denies that we are a community because of a matter of definition, and he sees horrible motives in the lack of an Amazon rainforest article, 
::never said that.  I said I see horrible bias in the lack of such an article when there are dozens detailing every character that ever appeared in Ayn Rand.  

:it seems highly unlikely that debating with this individual will result in anything relevant to Wikipedia. I also suggest to 24 that he start his own project that is more in line with his aims. --Stephen Gilbert
::it's nice what you believe.  however, this project pretends to be interested in a neutral point of view, and what I see here is grossly biased towards people whose world-view comes wholly from physics, mathematics, television and Ayn Rand.  And, of course, the 1911 Encyclopedia Brittanica which is about the ultimate Pro-British-Empire view, by definition.  I am not part of a community, nor your clique, but am committed to a political process to make this project better, and am entirely willing to make that process work better.  Even people who hate me have participated in it to some degree, e.g. by adding [[worst cases]] etc.  If you won't, that suggests to me that you are trying to take over this project, and simply wish to avoid negotiation.

----

I don't think that 24 really understands the NPOV policy.  24 writes:
&quot;It remains to be see if people here wish to find the actual median of
global human opinion.&quot;  And also: &quot;There are 6100 million potential
readers of the wikipedia, long term, and views shared near-universally
by 100-300 million of them just aren't good enough to qualify as
neutral point of view, if there is serious dispute about them among
the other 5800-6000 million people.&quot;

But NPOV is not about finding the 'median' of human opinion, nor about
presenting only views that are &quot;shared near-universally&quot; by only
Western, technologically advanced, American, or whatever other group
he means.

The examples he gives of things that we wouldn't even want to have in
the encyclopedia betray his misunderstanding.  Selecting just one of
them, &quot;hate views of ethnic groups&quot; is certainly something that
Wikipedia should have an article on.  But the wikipedia should take no
position &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; those views, but should instead present
those views in such a way that both proponents and detractors can
mutually agree.

Similarly, imagine that 24's hypothetical poll of the entire world
shows that most beleive that &quot;9/11 was caused by US foreign policy&quot; --
what should the wikipedia say about that?  Well, nothing less than
that a poll of the entire world showed that a majority of the world
believes that &quot;9/11 was caused by US foreign policy&quot;.  Hopefully our
reporting on this fact would be enhanced by an NPOV discussion of the
reasons why many people believe that, an NPOV discussion of what
Americans believe, and why, and so on.

His threat to post to indymedia.org to bring an onslaught of
progressives is interesting and revealing, as well.  Brion Vibber's
response was correct: please do, go and bring them in.  If lots of
them come all at once, there will be a period of chaos while they come
to understand our NPOV policies, but after that, those who can
tolerate NPOV writing will stick around, and that'll be great.  It'll
help keep those of us who do not share their viewpoints &quot;in line&quot;.

But if his indymedia.org friends want to violate the NPOV, then they
will be just as unwelcome as, say, libertarians who come in and want
to violate the NPOV.  Even such &quot;stupid&quot; followers of Ayn Rand, as
your humble host would be held to the fire just as heartily for NPOV
violations.

The interesting thing about the NPOV is that all reasonable people can
understand why we have the policy and adhere to it.  I suppose that if
a large group of people descended on us, people who steadfastly reject
the NPOV *itself* for some reason, insisting that instead of working
hard to reach unanimity on articles, wikipedia should be like Usenet,
with endless shouting and reversals back-and-forth and back-and-forth
of articles from one point of view to another until someone gets too
exhausted to continue...  if that happened, then we'd have a serious
problem.

But I don't think that such people exist in large numbers.  Even
people who I might personally regard as religious fanatics of one
stripe or another generally _can_ agree to a neutral presentation of
the issues.

Having said all of this, I think there is more to say about [[systemic
bias in wikipedia]].

Is there a systemic bias due to the types of people initially
attracted to the project?  Quite possibly, but I don't think that this
has been demonstrated convincingly.  To be sure, the wikipedia is
_uneven_, as the [[w:Amazon rainforest]] (24: is this here yet?) example shows.  But unevenness and incompleteness is not bias, otherwise wikipedia will be &quot;biased&quot; until every possible sentence in every possible language has been entered.

How is Wikipedia biased?  There are many articles that take into
account what large numbers of people believe, even if no one here
believes those things.  We have some good articles on Islam, even
though -- to my knowledge, at least -- they were not written by
followers of Islam.

But other articles (or perhaps even the Islam articles!) may
inadvertantly leave out important points of view unknown to the
author.  To the extent that this is true, then Wikipedia is _not_
NPOV, even when we think it is, because of our current ignorance.  But
this is always true of every publication by every author -- we cannot
write about that which we know too little.  At least with Wikipedia,
our _model_ is fertile for change in the right direction.

p.s.  I think it would have been better had Axel not redirected your 'viral license' article, and had instead edited it.  But you've made something of a spectacle of yourself with all these accusations!
:I appreciate that, but it's inevitable, as there is an ideological clique here, that belives they ARE somehow NPOV, whereas I agree with you that &quot;Wikipedia is _not_ NPOV, even when we think it is, because of our current ignorance. &quot;
:therefore, maybe you can review what's in [[governance]] and see if that is a good way to assess what &quot;we&quot; think, and [[three billionth user]] to see if those are the right questions to ask about the user (100th, 1 millionth, or otherwise).
:when you *HAVE* some process for that, you may become a community of sorts.

24 responds - I believe there is value to some of these confrontations if they generate insight into meta issues - and I am doing my best to ensure that what has been learned in these confrontations has been recorded somehow - in &quot;talk&quot; at least.  This whole flap about assuming [[w:particle physics]] as a universal [[w:foundation ontology]] (which is a narrow base on which [[w:cosmology]] rests as far as I am concerned) is quite a common one in cross-cultural projects.  It's expected, and so is the &quot;closing ranks&quot; of all those who don't see any problem in the words &quot;[[w:Standard Model]]&quot; necessarily referring only to [[w:particle physics]].  I have made that point over and over again, and won't bother to critique [[w:Karl Popper]], [[w:dualism]] or [[w:reductionism]] in the meta.  I won't convince LDC, Axel Boldt, Olof, who have apparently chosen to defend these habits to the death.

What I have to say about this is said in [[the future of wikipedia]] and my major questions are in [[value system]] and [[three billionth user]].

And no, I don't believe that the &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; convention is enough.  [[vocabulary]], [[certainty]], [[appropriation]] of point of view, all play major roles in determining how that [[three billionth user]] sees all this.

I'm asking you to get specific.  Ideally we'd be pouring our [[w:collective intelligence]] into listing [[threats]], [[worst cases]], [[best cases]] and [[visions]] and then compiling them, using the same terms as those, into a [[status quo]] view that would tell us where the contributors think we stand.

Is that unreasonable?  What percentage of time should go into this versus the writing or editing of articles?  We can pre-empt conflict at least by showing that these issues exist, so that vast flood of new indymedia writers doesn't totally break the structure, ignore the standards, and frustrate the existing contributors.  What I've written is very very mild compared to what some of them believe!  

:Which only means that it will be rectified even faster. Your thinly veiled threats of a trickle of indymedia writers doesn't impress anyone here, so you may as well cut that out. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]
::a foundation of good articles that try to deal honestly with the genuine debates in the real world, not *only* the nonsense academics spout at each other outside of the practice of the subject in reality (e.g. [[w:ontology]]), will absorb even extreme opinions as annotations and etc..
::I'm not talking about a trickle.  I'm talking about the 50,000 people who joined ICANN to elect Andy Mueller-Maguhn and Karl Auerbach in 2000.  And the hundreds of thousands more who read and contribute to indymedia itself.  Have fun resisting, if when the tidal wave hits.  Now, I'm talking to you and I'm capable of understanding every word and responding to it, which is more than most of them will do.  I'm trying to help you establish a sense of what your so-called &quot;community&quot; actually believes in terms of [[visions]], [[best cases]] and [[threats]], and I appreciate that to some people I myself am one of their [[worst cases]].  Fine.  So what?  You still need to assess what you as a clique believe, if only to organize your resistance to people like me.  I'm helping you do that by announcing this point of view, clarifying it as one of many in articles that are far too narrow (economics articles with no mention of Marx?  ontology articles with no mention of theology?  Come on Axel... this is nowhere near neutral now)

:::I just told you that your threats are laughable, and all you can think of is repeat them. Oh, and of course your tiresome ad about your &quot;governance&quot;. It's worse than a TV commercial. Do you like TV commercials? I don't. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

But if &quot;[[w:Standard Model]]&quot; of wikipedia equals [[w:particle physics]] by tautology in the minds of one clique, this is already quite over.  The wiki will be useful only to [[w:Eliezer Yudkowsky]] and no one else - and given that, his &quot;Friendly AI&quot; project will be very very unfriendly for its ignorance of [[w:ecology]], [[w:civil society]], and everything else that's alive and thriving.  While being &quot;Friendly&quot; to particle physicists, it will chew up every other resource on Earth to build more particle accelerators.  It will happily accept funding dollars from [[w:Amazon rainforest]] destruction or [[w:Great Ape]] [[w:genocide]] - because it won't know about them.  Or, at best, it will know so little about them compared to [[w:particle physics]] that it will have to assume that non-physics [[w:foundation ontology]] composed of disposable crap like bodies, ecologies, and morality just don't matter.  To most Americans, b.t.w., &quot;standard model&quot; means a car.

Which has its own well-documented ecological and social devastation impact...

This is the most serious problem wiki could have - and if you resist even the simplest and least controversial attempts to lay down a cross-cultural base of phrases in the titling scheme, and let clowns like LDC become your &quot;chief editor&quot;, that's a house of cards.

The clashing views, by the thousands, will pour in and wipe out the useless structure built on that fragile and narrow base.  I'm trying to build a broad base that can accomodate some quite odd but ancient and often useful ideas - but that's being resisted.  If [[w:cosmology]] is something defined only by physicists, well... that has nothing to do with the [[three billionth user]]'s most likely and vital concerns.  And thus nothing to do with [[w:civil society]], or human survival.  It is just another means to distract us from [[w:primate extinction]] - our own, as we are amused to death by games played with expensive toys:  weapons, particle accelerators, and perhaps universities themselves.

24, we're trying to create a free encyclopedia to the best of our ability and we can never reach ''perfect'' NPOV, but we try. 

:if you can visualize what ''perfect'' NPOV is like in practice, I hope you can write that vision down clearly as one of the [[visions]]

:that is what I tried to do in [[Natural point of view]], which is referenced in one of the [[visions]] I wrote. 24

Sure, it may have western biases since we're using English, but that's the fault of the language, not the encyclopedia.  According to the Almanac World Book of Facts, only about 500 million people can even speak English, so thinking of the 3 billionth user is pretty proposterous unless you're thinking of about some 30 years down the road (and who knows... by then 
Chinese could easily be the &quot;international language&quot;).  With that said, I 

:that's entirely reasonable, and if you want to edit [[three billionth user]] to make it entirely in Chinese, that's an entirely legitimate comment.  Or, if you like, to lay out based on the Book of Facts and some assumptions about who gets to the net when (is that number there?), exactly when we hit these different communities. 24

wonder what your proportion of time is spent working on articles and that spent talking about articles.  

:about five to one, walk to talk.  As [[Nicholas Negroponte says &quot;we all need to pay more attention to politics&quot;.  Realistically, though, if people don't share a [[w:cosmology]] or even a [[w:foundation ontology]], let alone a vague understanding of how those impact the [[w:dictionary]], there's going to be conflict.  Time is saved, service maximized, by focusing on just that, and working out governance, truce, etc., means.  For instance Axel added a little two-liner to [[worst cases]] which is probably an attempt to characterize what he thinks I'm doing, which is fair, as I did the same to characterize what I think he's doing... that is already useful cooperation.

:in the long run, it's probably the only way to go, for the most obnoxious or controversial people (e.g. me) to focus on meta concerns and set up systems for others to criticize the hell out of me.  As [[w:Larry Flynt]] used to say, &quot;If I'm safe, you know you're safe, because I'm the worst.&quot;  My hero.

I mean right now I could be writing or editing articles, but I'm here responding to your critiques.  If you really want a 

:I very much appreciate that.  In fact, I hope you can work with me to lay out some files to anticipate [[five hundred millionth user]] (who still spekas English) and [[one billionth user]] (who doesn't speak it very well, but is already using the Internet) 24

more neutral wikipedia, you could try the Esperanto wikipedia...  --[[user:Chuck Smith|Chuck Smith]]

:Eventually I'm sure I will, but when I watch TV I see people speaking English in need of a little more general knowledge, not people speaking Esperanto.  ;-)  The articles here, hopefully, over a long period of time, will become standard and non-controversial enough that people cite from them on TV and don't question their neutrality.  Maybe that's the definition of &quot;neutral&quot;?  Both sides on [[w:CNN Crossfire]] cite from you and accept the source...? 24

----

Goodness gracious, 24, is it really that difficult? If there's '''actually''' something that's '''actually''' called the &quot;Standard Model&quot; in a field other

:I knew of about six once, but two of them were the same... 24

than particle physics that needs writing up, we separate the page into &quot;Standard Model (particle physics)&quot; and &quot;Standard Model (foo)&quot; and set up &quot;Standard Model&quot; as a [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Disambiguating_pages disambiguating page]. --[[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

:I agree, that works fine.  The problem is that it isn't done from day one, giving the impression that &quot;Standard Model (particle physics)&quot; is somehow more important than &quot;standard model (automobile)&quot; - the most widely spread meaning, or [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/ &quot;Standard Model (DOM)&quot;] as certain extreme geeks might expect.  But that just wasn't the point.

:My point is that [http://www-donut.fnal.gov/web_pages/standardmodelpg/TheStandardModel.html this], that the &quot;Standard Model (particle physics)&quot; is one of many [[w:foundation ontology]] or [[w:cosmology]] options, ways to look at the known universe.  We should be careful about usurpation of terms which are extremely standard, e.g. would you not also want me to be extremely careful about &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot;, and &quot;Greenpeace&quot;?  Three radically different things, and seemingly politically charged even to allow them to be abbreviated or used with or without capital letters.

::If there were no article &quot;Green&quot; or &quot;Peace&quot;, I'd '''love''' for you to put in an article about your concept of &quot;green&quot; or &quot;Green&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;Peace&quot;. Then, when somebody else came in with other concepts related to these terms, they would add the other concepts, dividing them up into separate pages if necessary. I really honestly think that would be '''great''', the embodiment of what we're trying to do on wikipedia. So I think you can see that I don't share your concern, here. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

:I understand the naming convention, and I understand the flaws in the user interface software that shove capital letters everywhere (which is not done in any dictionary and should not be done in any encyclopedia or any GUI),

::24, you never made a response about the questions raised in [[w:Talk:7-Eleven]] about case issues. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]
:::if I wasn't under constant attack by ideologists who believe that they have no ideology, I'd have much more time for that.  I doubt I'll get to it at this point, unfortunately.  There is absolutely no point in setting new conventions or fixing software for people who keep reverting any mention of governance of this project so that no one can even ask anyone else for their views of its future in an organized way.  This project will die without some attention to [[governance]], and until I'm sure it's going to live I don't see why I should contribute to its structure.  This crap talk about &quot;being a community&quot; while acting like a bunch of infallible cliques, doesn't appeal, and people removing Swedish Bank Prize in Economics winners' opinions from economics pages, is just beyond belief.  This place is full of Randroids or something.

:and I am not asking for anything other than recognition that the foundation beliefs of all people speaking the English language to any degree (or forced to do so to use the Internet)

::Wikipedia is multilingual, and hopefully the wikis in other languages will continue to grow, where they exist, and begin, where they do not yet. Our [[three billionth user]] might not even be using the English wiki. [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]
:::possibly not.  But there will still be a hundred-millionth, a two-hundred millionth, etc.  I'd happily go with the consensus as to where we should set the mark.  But insisting that only this 1000 or so people here define a neutral point of view, given the self-selection and early bias of the project, is outrageous, we have to admit that we just aren't neutral and need a model of our Nth reader to guide what we write, what level of vocabulary we use, etc.

:represent &quot;just as legitimate&quot; ways of looking at the world than anything that could come out of any [[w:particle accelerator]].

:Catholics who follow Pope John Paul II, for instance, or Buddhists, are much more likely to see an ethically structured or founded universe, where choices about what particles decide to be seen or not may have more to do with what level of insight the universe (or &quot;God&quot;, which 80% of people speaking English believe in to some degree) decides to let us have.  A hard core of materialist atheists may well compose 95% of the [[w:wikipedians]], but if they make no attempt to comprehend the world-view of even the [[w:one millionth user]] then this project will be rewriting forever and ever and ever - and driving away the exact people who we would like to come here and get into things.

:none of this would have arisen at all if not for LDC limiting [[w:meme]] to his personal understanding of Dawkin's unscientific model, or Axel refusing to accept most notable 20th century philosophers of mathematics as having made any kind of contribution to the field - 

::stop lying. The claim that [[w:Paul Erdos]] was a philosopher of mathematics is ridiculous on its face and cannot be supported by any reputable source. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]
:::and what about Turing, Wittgenstein, Russell, Whitehead?  Come on.  That's one name out of a dozen you cut out.  Play fair.  Erdos totally ignored and denied any view of math other than a universal world view.  He committed hsi body to it totally.  If you think someone who commits his entire life to something, thinking only about that thing, and doing only that thing, is not expressing a philosophy by example, you don't really believe in a philosophy of any kind yourself.  Shall I call him a *preacher* of mathematics?  Or a *theologian*?

:replacing that article with something so abstract as to be pointless.  To both of their credit, they are trying, and aren't engaged in mindless censorship, but are reflecting (honestly) a limited view of the world.  Fair enough.  LDC's Extropian views or Axel's Neo-Platonist views or my Green views don't affect our articles beyond reason.  We all include and exclude certain things, but if we don't cut out text wholesale (as I *never* have), we're forced to encounter those views.  

:I was willing to work within custom for a while.  But when I am forced to justify, with some 'source', the idea that a community is originally (and could or should still be considered), people sharing [[w:risk]] of [[w:bodily harm]], as I was by April, the bias is beyond clear - it is becoming endemic.  This is not personal - probably 80% of Western world academics will share these biases of theirs - but so what?

: any reasonably honest attempt to assess the beliefs, vocabulary, and attitudes of even the [[one millionth user]], rather than trying to see wikipedia as strictly &quot;an end in itself&quot; or science as the only world-view, will satisfy me.  I'm trying.  See [http://meta.wikipedia.com meta home] and if you see nothing about governance there, try [[governance]] or [[best cases]].

:anarchy is work.  If we want a system that lets anyone do anything anytime we are going to be working a lot harder than if we have some shared [[visions]].

:Godspeed, 24
----
The Wiki software is available freely to anyone. If you dislike what this group is doing, set up your own.
:I don't necessarily dislike it, nor like it.  &quot;this group&quot; changes often anyway.  What I dislike is the [[w:groupthink]] which constantly justifies its own ignorance, which is relatively typical of any group based on academia.  I could certainly set up my own and supercede this project at some future point, if it can't adapt to the constraints of the larger world that it lives in.  But that is not up to me to decide.  Since this project is here, and these people are here, and I don't have any reason to believe they are bad people to work with, here I am, and I am making it better, if only by covering controversial topics that the existing &quot;community&quot; doesn't dare cover, e.g. politics, religion, basic fiat issues in economics, because it would clearly break them up into &quot;tribes&quot;.  That scares them, but to me, it is useful, the beginning of [[governance]].  Along the way, some who seek to keep it a clique will be offended.  This will either be fatal to the project, or not, it will either break them up, or not.  But I am being cast in the role of Satan here - being told that somehow I am the only one who sees the NPOV policy as descriptive of a process, not a full prescription (Which it clearly is not).

Telling us that we aren't a meaningful community because we don't fit your geographical/danger definition isn't going to get you anywhere. 
:if I wanted to &quot;get anywhere&quot;, I'd get up off my ass, and go for a walk.  What's your point?

Do I magically become part of a North London community while I'm visiting friends there? Or am I still American/New Yorker/etc.? 
:you are a member of that community to the degree you share its risk of bodily harm.  You will certainly feel like an Israeli if you are at a Jerusalem cafe when a suicide bomber happens by, and certainly like a Palestinian when an Israeli tank shell hits your house.  Beyond that, it's nothing but talk, hm?

The goal of this project isn't to assess the beliefs, vocabulary, or attitudes of a hypothetical millionth user? it's to create an encyclopedia. 166.84.202.xxx
:you will create nothing but junk not worth reading without *SOME* concept of your audience, and what service your article is supposed to do for them, aside from demonstrating your own cleverness.  You must at least choose to cover a certain range of topics, and omit others.
----
Actually 24, I think the above is a bit of a fallacy from not participating enough in wiki(s) before.  Each of the individual up to the millionth user has the chance to &quot;wikify&quot; the content that they are interested in.  So each individual can choose individually.   This now appears to me to be a smaller project team than it originally appeared so you may be misunderstanding what is required for success at this point. 
:I just don't believe your assertion that offering &quot;the chance to &quot;wikify&quot;&quot; overcomes the social barriers.  Look, I just tested this thesis over the past few weeks - I showed up with a rather wide range of carefully-researched material that was needed here, although some of it assumed terms of art or levels of prior understanding or lack of desire to impose personal ideology.  A couple of pieces were not neutrally written.  However, the process over the past few weeks shows that some highly reactive people apply some simplistic tests to what they read, i.e. &quot;they don't like it&quot;, or &quot;it isn't on google&quot; by quite that name, and this requires a rather incredible uphill struggle even just to correct obvious things.  Advantage:  good articles at the end.  Disadvantage:  many people will not bother to fight Axel, or Larry, or LDC.

I would encourage you to participate at meta and here in a new fashion to get a feel for what I mean.  Try wandering around and adding a meaningful paragraph or link or fact to some incomplete or obviously draft articles for a while and get a feel for what it might turn into if tens, hundreds, and then thousands of interested users and editors have contributed a tidbit.  
:I've done that for a good many.  The outcome?  panic, assertions that everything written is somehow suspect or agenda'd, etc..  I know how this common policy writing/editing process works, I am damn good at it.  For things far more important than these articles.

This will keep you a little more clear of religious wars with existing wikipediasts who view themselves as article &quot;owners&quot; despite  some draft policy against this tendency.   As a fellow newcomer and revolutionist I would like to see you pace yourself and stick around for a long time.  As 
:well, that's reassuring.  I agree the &quot;owners&quot; are engaged in ideological combat, but you know, that's not bad, as long as they admit what that is.  For instance April, Axel Boldt, LDC, and Larry Sanger all admit what they believe quite openly and their biases can be dealt with.  They are all less problematic than people who simply say &quot;this is wrong&quot; when it isn't... when the four mentioned do this, it's easy to tell why they might believe so, and deal with it.  Axel in particular is worth engaging in a conversation with - whereas I've yet to see a note from Larry that isn't patronizing, abusive, an attempt at &quot;outing&quot;, or whatever.  LDC was ok in the start but got less so as time went on, clearly pushing an authority position - &quot;what you say has no value because we know who you are&quot; etc - and his highest ambition, being an &quot;Extropian&quot;, is to throw his own body in the garbage and convince us that the LDC-robot left over should be accorded his full human and property rights.  Well that is damn funny but it isn't a human being worthy of respect.  If all I did was clear people like these latter two off, I might be doing the project a big favor.  They don't seem to have the ethics or theory of value that they pretend to enforce.  And my method for dealing with hypocrisy is beyond unpleasant, so I'd rather Larry follow his own advice and ignore.  LDC at least said that he &quot;would not allow pages to become useless&quot; - so he knows they must be useful to *someone*... that's a start.

much as I toss the term fork around, I have a realistic view and some knowledge of the actual resources required to create such a thing and it is not trivial. 
:agreed.  Also, there is no reason to believe that they can't learn from this or a general revolution... think, if this project can essentially be taken over by political means from the inside, and forced to commit to some serious [[governance]] that isn't imposing values, that says much good for the project and people.24

Let us at least learn from the local success, failures, mistakes and awewsome innovation before we go to the drudgery of creating a derived site for some alternate purpose or ideology.   
:well, I don't see how the wikipedia can be considered an end in itself, unlike Axel, and I don't see how giving reasonably smart (high school level English) people a solid general reference on problems they hear about and face every day, could be considered an &quot;alternate purpose&quot;.  Also I don't see how continuing to breath and drink clean water and eat and not be killed by robots claiming to &quot;be&quot; LDC (in Larry's strange [[w:ontology]] they probably &quot;are&quot; him) can considered an &quot;ideology&quot;. 24

An example might be a simplified version appropriate to self study via the internet in 3rd world/4rth world nations where English is a 2nd language.  This would help create the 3 Billionth user.
[[user:mirwin]]
:Exactly the point.  But then what does *this* wikipedia do?  Help Yudkowsky's &quot;Friendly AI&quot; to bootstrap itself into Larry-and-LDC-like body ignorance?  Experiments on humans because they believe in Descartes' Other, and &quot;the screams of pain of animals are no more than the chiming of a clock?&quot;  Hmm.  Then what?  Seems to me that if we have to fork this project, then this one becomes a biohazard - because it *isn't* serving such users... Also, if you can't get the best contributors to write to such a useful level, aren't you enabling a massive &quot;Singularity&quot; type technology upswing among the native English speakers, long term, which they use to kill everyone else?  I'm not as sanguine about the use of knowledge as others.  I view it as mostly destructive and alienating - and would point to the personalities of such as Larry and LDC as examples.  These guys went wrong in the vat somewhere.  Yeesh. 24

... and the World witnesses breathlessly the birth of a new party!

Or maybe simply &quot;Embodied Synergy&quot;? [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]
:not bad.  But I'd settle for just creating a simple [[w:Green Party]] that could follow the [[w:Four Pillars of the Green Party]] to build a simple [[w:consensus process]] to replace all this silly ideological fencing around faux rationality.  Mainstream science, especially [[w:ecology]], could be the basis for initial statements, and then objections to the scientific view could be accomodated via that process, rather than via the clamor that seems standard here today.</text>

What is Wikipedia's '''value system'''? Please enter your opinions below. We are also interested in contributors' and users individual [[value systems]] and [[visions]] for the project. But not here. Please state here what you think wiki's shared value system is, to the best of your own ability.

----
Collaboratively synergize to the best; implement some type of version control and attribution; make it freely publicly available. Chit chat with the rest of community (and other users) randomly to help fix/update mistakes, omissions, etc. inevitable from casual public access and wiki creation process; iterate to global prosperity. [[User:mirwin]]

:Correction The above personal summary may be drafted on the main site in various files in written form to some extent but it appears that there is widespread disagreement, disregard and variation in applied values. In my opinion &quot;We&quot; are still a collection of individuals and owners, not a &quot;community&quot;, team, or group with a vision we can articulate to newcomer's and successfully meet the implied [[w:social contract]] of the [[w:GPL]]/[[w:FDL]]. In my opinion this is more than a bit duplicious when combined with the urgent emphasis to write and interact only on the article pages and preferably in the form of complete articles. This project appears to verge on attempting to fraudulently exploit &quot;ignorant&quot; (of local undocumented &quot;community&quot; values and methods) newcomer's until they grow grumpy, divert them to written materials (which are capriciously disregarded at will with impunity by some, while selectively enforced against others) to keep them productively around for a while longer adding value in pursuit of a saleable encyclopedia product, and then encourage them to leave if they grow intractable since they will not comply with &quot;owner&quot; dictates that appear to violate written and unwritten guidelines which assert that there are no hard and fast guidelines. [[User:mirwin]]
----
As is the case in many (if not all) communities, Wikipedia's value system is tacit. Most people are not aware of there being a value system at work.

Le systeme de valeur actuel de Wikipedia consiste essentiellement a laisser impunemment quelques editeurs reverter sans fin les points de vue allant a l'encontre du point de vue global americain, les autres editeurs s'amusant probablement de voir quelque debile legere essayer de sauver les apparences d'une encyclopedie ayant un objectif de neutralite totalement hypothetique et irrealiste. C'est d'une infinie tristesse. Et oui, c'est exact, la plupart des editeurs ne sont meme pas conscients de la fraude magistrale a laquelle ils participent. Et je me demande ce que je fais la. Je pense avoir eventuellement enfin atteint le stade ou je realise combien ma presence nuit a la bonne marche d'un produit uniquement destine a des foules dont je ne souhaite pas faire partie.</text>

The '''three billionth user''' of wikipedia represents roughly the median user who we should be considering in understanding what is [[w:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]].  Why the three billionth user, and not a floating number halfway down the list of all people on Earth (by whatever criteria you insist upon using)?

For stability, and balance.  Assume, perhaps controversially, that the [[w:value system|value system]] of the first hundred million users (who pour in and perfect the &quot;knowledge&quot; included) has little or nothing to do with the [[w:use-value|use-value]] of articles to the six billion other people on this planet, who thereafter become &quot;customers&quot; - and whose interests should guide the evolution of the work.  Since we know that the value system of that first hundred million is drastically different due to [[w:self-selection effects|self-selection effects]] and the perspective of the [[w:developed nations|developed nations]] where most [[w:Internet users|Internet users]] reside today, it is important for us to think of ways to balance that value system and its inherent [[w:culture bias|culture bias]] - without necessarily inviting in the hundred million people who hate encyclopedias, knowledge, the Internet, English language and &quot;The Western World&quot;, which would be the most obvious way to go.

Good [[w:statistical measurement|statistical measurement]]s discard outliers, and the first hundred million wikis, just like the presumed-hundred-million wiki-haters, should be ruled out of the analysis for being impossible to satisfy one way or another.

Please, add below, literally anything you can find out about the three billionth person on Earth to read any wikipedia article:

Male or female?  Old or young?  What is their first language?  What is their English vocabulary?  Their religion?  

What year is it, that this three-billionth person gets online and surfs over to wiki?  How do they get their Internet access?  Do they pay for it?  Is there a time limit on their use?  Can they print a page and read it offline?

What article are they reading?  What's it linked to, and why?  How is it structured?  Does the first paragraph have any reliable specific function?  How do typography and link conventions make it easier to skip irrelevant data?

What are they doing just prior to reading it, and just after?  Is their access mobile?  Are the pages being read into their ear, or seen on a screen?  Are there practical instructions that they need to step through in the article?  Are they explaining the contents to a child, or a colleague?

What would offend them?  What would be dangerous for them to believe?  What would be a good enough explanation for them to never care about this again?

PLEASE, copy the questions, and answer them in your case or scenario below:

-------

I disagree strongly with the notion that the purpose of our writing should be to satisfy the desires of the 3 billionth user.  What would offend them?  NPOV doesn't care.  What would be dangerous for them to believe?  NPOV doesn't care.
: What would be useful to them?  The NPOV doesn't care.  What would be acceptable to the contributors but clearly wrong from the point of view of the users?  NPOV doesn't care.  I submit that NPOV is not a real [[value system]] and that the project needs one.  You seem to use the term &quot;NPOV&quot; like &quot;GOD&quot;. 24

Imagine for a moment a fundamentalist of any stripe (Green, libertarian, Islamic, Christian, whatever) who believes as you apparently do that presentation of ideas should be primarily guided by views of what is dangerous or not, offensive or not, and who believes this so strongly that they are opposed to the NPOV itself.  Then, they will be happier reading and writing elsewhere.
: danger and offense merely reduce the probability of a good service result - they are not in themselves reasons to censor, no, and presentation of ideas can be *shaped* or *prioritized* &quot;by views of what is dangerous or not, offensive or not,&quot;, and no, this does not necessarily require an author sensitive to danger nor offense to be &quot;opposed to the NPOV itself,&quot; just as one who does not share the details of A-bomb making or anthrax brewing is not necessarily opposed to academic freedom or reproducibility of experiment...

I think that such people are rare, except in the fevered vision of the fundamentalist.  
:which is increasingly common, and increasingly the world's worst problem by some lights.  BTW you make a mistake above.  A [[w:Gaian]] can certainly be a fundamentalist, many are, but it is hard for [[w:Greens]] to be such, as they must be arrayed in twos to fives in order to apply their [[w:consensus process]] at all, and as it gives pre-eminence to ecological wisdom, the fundamentals are perceived only through the lens of the empirical.  See [[w:Natural_point_of_view]] - it is not *opposed* to the neutrality or neutralizing process you seek.24

Virtually everyone understands the NPOV, and uses it in day to day life, though perhaps not consistently.
:true, they neutralize speech through a sort of a protocol or dialogue.  We are doing that here,  now.  If the three billionth is not relevant, who is?  If these questions aren't important, which are?  Certainly vocabulary and prevalence of concepts are important, as people fight fiercely to preserve certain conventions of name-space, etc.24

--[[Jimbo Wales]]
:when you open an encyclopedia, what do you expect out of it ?  &quot;the truth&quot;?  If so, how are you different from a fundamentalist?  (some call it &quot;scientism&quot;)

----

What is your point?  NPOV is non-negotiable.  I'd be happy to discuss it with you, in email, but trust me, you'll be wasting your typing if you're trying to change my mind.  Do you want to set up your own Green wiki?  I will help you. 
But wikipedia is wikipedia, and if you don't like having to write from the NPOV, then too bad.
--[[Jimbo Wales]]

: the point of the above seems to be that NPOV is a myth if the three billionth user can't read the wikipedia, or edit it, and apply their own point of view - also it's absurd to imply that only a tiny empowered group of people get to say what NPOV is, and even more absurd to say that such a thing as NPOV can be 'non-negotiable'  - it appears that some folks are just being reactionary here
::Seems the the above user didn't realize that Jimbo Wales can say who can and can't say what NPOV is because he essentially owns the place.  [[User:The Final Dream|The Final Dream]] 01:35, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
:::Egad, I don't know what else Jimbo would have to do in order to prove that is not true.  What Jimbo thinks about NPOV is pretty clear, and while he dictates that WP has it, he doesn't dictate what it is.

----

You are absolutely right in talking about developed-centrism, self-selection-phenomena etc. Still ''Wikipedia is not for a single user'', even if she/he is 3 billionth.

:'''3 billionth''': In 2015. She's young from India and got access from school, cause he's poor enough not to have her own computer. His parents knew nothing about Western life and consider her ''Westernized'' but at least as for Encyclopedia (I'm not sure the name will still be Wikipedia) he's sure he'd never get such an interesting source of information without Internet. Their university uses Encyclopedia in everyday life, so it's hard to tell what article will be first. But she quickly starts entering articles about his local Chinese province. --[[User:Ilya|Ilya]] 23:30, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::Is he/she transgender? Why do you change the personal pronouns all the time? Further, if he/she is from India, how can he/she have a local Chinese province? [[User:Polyglot|Polyglot]] 15:02, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:::That's the point. We shouldn't cater to the needs of a specific indvidual, even if they are #3,000,000,000. - [[User:Calmypal|Calmypal]] 04:12, 2 May 2004 (UTC)

Looks like it was a third party half-edit from a Chinese man to an Indian woman causing the point to be lost. The user could be a Jewish Rabbi in Brooklyn. Or a mechanic from Switzerland of uncertain gender. Or a transexual Canadian professor. India/China was chosen as a cultural bias towards populous regions. It was changed from male to female to highlight gender bias. The grammar errors may indicate some sort of faulty educational background, which is also assumed of the 3B'th user, which shows ingrained bias as well. It's a curiously comic display of the point it is trying to make.
:Is tran-sexual the next big thing after metro-sexual?

----

I think you need to consider the probability or likelihood that the 3bnth user is being served WP content and doesn't know or care that it is from WP, that it is part of a mashup or distillation from a 3rd party source that is providing a value-add.  This supposes that WP content is considered valuable and can be used by 3rd parties to generate profit.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical|Circa 2003}}This page describes only anticipated '''threats''' to the wikipedia.  Threats are extreme hypothetical too-bad-to-be-true cases with high impact but no measurable probability - because they havent happened yet.  They are fictions.

The ideal threat is something you have never seen but only heard of, and which you personally do not believe in, but you know that others do - this allows you to report it neutrally and editorialize a bit since you have no dignity at stake.  A good threat would combine multiple weird scenarios and get to the point of the ridiculous.

If you are describing something with evidence, that you believe 'has' already happened to some degree, or has a measurable probability, it is a [[worst cases|worst case]] and 'not' a &quot;threat&quot;.  

Enter examples of threats that may damage or destroy [[the future of wikipedia]], and absolutely prevent ever reaching m/any of the [[best cases]] or [[visions]]:

----

The [[w:particle physics]] cultists require that everything in wikipedia be explained in terms of its relationship to the [[w:Standard Model]].  Anything less [[w:reductionist]] or [[w:dualist]] or not subject to [[w:falsifiability]] in a [[w:particle accelerator]] by a trusted clique of reductionist physicists is removed from wiki.  [[w:Eliezer Yudkowsky]] gets his &quot;Friendly AI&quot; working and it destroys the world by believing this wiki view of it, and running an experiment on the [[w:Standard Model]] that rips a hole in reality and sucks us all in.  [[w:Great Apes]] never get their chance.

The [[w:anti-globalization movement]] decides to postmodernize every article - the thousands of strange contradictory doctrines, each touted by a single academic somewhere in the world, fill up the wiki and render all articles unreadable masses of new age [[w:postmodernism]].  [[Vocabulary]] expands to 10, 20, 30 thousand English words - [[w:ebonics]], [[w:bop]], [[w:rap]], [[w:Pig latin]] and [[w:Engrish]] are given full status as legitimate languages.  Each article attempts to deconstruct twenty or thirty others, and relate a dozen or more theorists in a complex conceptual map.  wiki degrades to google.

----

As content and usage increases it suddenly becomes apparent to a few that insufficient tools or forums exist for newcomers to impact
the collective existing &quot;consensus&quot; regarding procedures
and appropriate usage or contribution.   This would
of course limit the scalability of wikipedia locally and
could lead to a fork, mirror or commercial competitor 
achieving the greater coveted &quot;mind share&quot;.

Do we have a defined target &quot;mind share&quot; to help guide
site feature design and content selection? [[w:user:mirwin]]
:good question, but don't ask it here.  In the threats page you should assume the worst and write from that worst.  Also I'm not sure that I don't believe that your threat here hasn't already happened, in which case its a worst case.  I suggest that you assume that it has already happened, and add to [[worst cases]] a mild believable version of that view.  And, that you expand your version here in threats to something so bad that neither you nor I would be likely to believe it is possible, but which could reasonably be said to be believable by a &quot;naive third party&quot;.   Then, remove both your older view and this guidance, replacing it with the threat.  For illustration's sake you may wish to link over to worst cases as well, to demonstrate the differences for others.  Also, there are not enough [[best cases]], it would be good if you'd add a case there too.  This exchange can be left in the diff or moved elsewhere but please don't leave it in threats.  Thankx, 24

This page describes only your unrealistic '''visions''' for the wikipedia.  Visions are extreme hallucinatory daydreaming, too-good-to-be-true ideals with high impact but no measurable probability - because they can't happen.  They're fantasy.  No one believes in them.  Not even you.  They're fiction.

The ideal vision is something you have never admitted to anybody at all, for fear they would laugh at you or drastically degrade you to other people for &quot;not being realistic&quot; or &quot;ignoring reality&quot; or some such cynical claim.

If you have ever heard a truly compelling vision of what the world could be &quot;if only...&quot; from anyone else in your life, this is the place to finally write it down.  Anonymity is best since you may hold back if others know your name.  A good vision would contain fantasy elements from all utopias you ever believed in, and several that you laughed at, and riduculed other people for.

If you are describing something that you consider a reasonable goal, that you believe ''can'' ever actually happen to any substantial degree, or has a measurable probability, it is a [[best cases]] and ''not'' a &quot;vision&quot;.  Be very careful with this distinction - [[best cases]] are something we allocate real [[w:human capital]] and (indirectly) [[w:natural resources]] to get done... a single good vision, however, would break us, were we even to really attempt it.

Enter examples of visions that far exceed anything ever considered as [[The Future of Wikipedia]], include all of the compatible [[best cases]], and render wiki immune to all [[threats]] in the bargain.

--------

The few language-using [[w:Great Apes]] and the last [[w:Stone Age Amazonians]] become the honorary editorial board, new editors have to prove their subject is relevant to their satisfaction, and wiki moves its legal headquarters into the [[w:Amazon rainforest]] for tax reasons.  A working wiki editorial board from [[w:civil society]] grows into a functioning [[w:world government]] using wild rainforest acres as its banking standard - the more of these you preserve, the richer you are.  Aliens finally reveal that this level of wisdom was what they were waiting to see before they revealed themselves.  All medical technology and body modification methods are revealed to humans who can take their place among civilized species of the universe.  Offhand, an alien ambassador admits that all humans would have been tortured to death in medical experiments if not for wiki deciding to &quot;respect the next species up the ladder the way that you wanted to be respected by us superior types&quot;.  Everyone gets a good laugh out of the last [[w:particle accelerator]] being turned into a new age gambling casino... and golfers voluntarily give up the game, gollums give up AI and nanotech, in favor of dancing, singing, gardening, extremely creative sex, vegan cooking.  Great articles on all these things with step-by-step instructions appear in wiki, so fast that no one could keep up, and they are edited and improved by cliques oriented around [[value systems]] who each keep their own fork of wiki.  [[Vocabulary]] is miraculously kept low enough that a very clever ape or very dumb human or someone who learned English from [[w:Zero Wing]] can understand the instructions.

:Also, all of these people, primates and extraterrestrials realize that [[Wikipedia is not Wiki]]. :)

----

[[w:Wikipedians]] never sling personal insults at each other, no matter how much they disagree. NOTE: this vision is much harder to achieve than the other two, since it conflicts with various personal agendas.

----

At some point, perhaps at [[Version 2.0]], the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] engraves the entire contents of Wikipedia and Wiktionary in all languages onto a number of stone tablets.  This is done in honor of Wikipedia's [[w:Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] [[Original Wikipedia|heritage]] and to preserve the entire accumulated [[w:Wikipedia:encyclopedic|encyclopedic]] knowledge of [[w:human|human]]ity.  The initial goal is to send the tablet sets (''lithipedias'') for each individual language to their language's native region; with the help of a generous donor, however, the Foundation is able to provide each country with lithipedias in their primary languages.

A series of proposals are developed and submitted to the [[w:European Space Agency|European Space Agency]] and the [[w:Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]].  Through coordination on Meta and the agencies' gracious support, a set of lithipedias suitable for especially harsh conditions is produced, each to be sent on one of several interstellar probes.  Luminaries wax about achieving the noble goals of preserving history for humankind and educating [[w:extraterrestrial life|race]]s across the [[w:galaxy|galaxy]] (as yet still undetected).  [[Wikipedians]] look to the future with hope.

This hope is to be short-lived, however.  International tensions are high; a country formerly known as the [[w:United States of America|United States of America]] (now officially the Democratic States of America) and referred to by most other countries as the &quot;rogue states of America&quot;, &quot;Rogue States&quot;, or simply &quot;The States&quot; has become increasingly arrogant and authoritarian in all affairs.  Confident in its supremacy and resentful of other countries' policies, it claims governance of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] and declares war upon the [[w:European Union|European Union]] when they oppose.

The survivors of this war, the largest in history, are few.  [[w:Area denial|Area denial]] measures far outlast the combatants; a critical level of damage is reached and then exceeded.  In two months [[w:civilization|civilization]] collapses across the world.  As hundreds of millions starve, the last desperate battles are fought until exhaustion.

In the decades that follow, the lithipedias prove their worth and are looked on as an endless, tragic fount of knowledge.  Lifespans are short, however, and soon the previous civilizations gain legendary, then mythical status.  It is as though humanity had risen against the gods and been destroyed for so doing; the lithipedias are believed to have been created by the gods afterward so that a new and wiser civilization might emerge.

It is in this setting, then, that one of the probes returns to Earth.  The excited witnesses to its descent from the heavens eventually discover how to open it, finding a single, familiar stone tablet inside.  They bring it to their [[WikiReader|LithiReader]] at once, and wait for the new message from the gods to be revealed.

Frustrating weeks pass as the Reader searches the tablet for the wisdom contained within.  Eventually cursing his eyesight, he travels to the village of another Reader, who is also unsuccessful.  She remembers a term used in certain rare texts, though, a term whose literal meaning was clear but which no Reader had been able to explain in any language of the lithipedia.

In time, similar tablets were found.  Readers came to loathe the blank pages for the time they wasted, but still more they hated the tablets filled with indecipherable scripts.  Thus, when the Outsiders finally arrived, humanity knew them as Vandals or Trolls and they were met with enmity rather than friendship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Best cases''' are probably scaled-down [[visions]] or the opposite of your most-dreaded [[threats]].  They may, also, really be your own best vision of where [[The future of Wikipedia]] might lead.  Don't be conservative.  What you write here should really be your own personal best idea of where it could go, and what would personally motivate you to work hard with people you hate, for no money, to achieve it.

The [[status quo]] is assessed in terms of [[worst cases]] - no one cares if you believe a best case is being achieved and if they did they wouldn't be checking the status quo - but [[threats]], [[visions]] and best cases help provide context and most imporantly set [[vocabulary]] in which the [[status quo]] is described.  Nothing original can be said in [[status quo]] - if it isn't mentioned in one of the other files it can't be mentioned there.

==Short term==

===Dedicated admins===
The Militia, 20 users granted sysop status, defend the users' [[visions]] to the near-death and all of these best cases are realized, and none of the [[threats]] come to pass.

===Full representation===
[[The ideal Wikipedia board]] is actually recruited and represents a range of cultures and biases, especially with respect to what or who is a 'person', and how authorship and anonymity should be handled.  These honest differences are settled with open debate and non-unanimous consensus, and wikipedia authors are generally comfortable with the level of security of person guaranteed by policy.

===Sensitivity to other points of view===
Hard to follow, but what about just the best case of [[w:symbiosis]] between [[troll]]s and even [http://disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=little_tin_god_sysop absurd sysops] (within limits) more or less [http://www.consumerium.org/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Etiquette as they discuss here]?

==Long term==

===Lasting success===
The Wikipedia project continues to evolve.  Its success is sufficient to be useful as a prototype/reference for derivative applications or projects seeking startup funding via traditional methods, volunteerism, or some viable combination.  [[user:mirwin]]

===Virtue as its own reward===
The [[w:anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization movement]] respects wiki as a [[neutral point of view]] and doesn't flood it with 3000 versions of [[natural point of view]] all at once.  Instead, they recognize that their views are treated with as much respect as funded published academics, and help work out a rigorous protocol for dealing with unpublished or unpublishable literature, work that challenges the validity of science itself, or calls for ends to professions.  The wiki becomes an icon of fairness for all those with heretical views, but somehow never becomes anathema to academics, who check it to see that their work is fairly represented, fix minor errors, and get into good &quot;talk&quot; with their most fervent opponents.

Wiki gradually becomes the center of discourse on controversial topics because of its vaunted fairness and its commitment to approaching as close to a natural point of view as the neutral point of view of the target [[three billionth user]] will permit.  Other encylopedias gradually give up or are bought out by donors who like wiki &amp;mdash; and wiki, rather than a search engine, becomes the first stop for most researchers.

Gradually, universities fade away as centers of research but flourish as centers of ethical training, moral example, brainstorming, wild and uninhibited art, and true creative vision.  Nobel Prize winners thank wiki on the stand as they accept their rewards, and historians credit it with breaking down barriers between academic, populist, and economic views.

==Extended future==

===Holism===
The [[w:foundation ontology|foundation ontology]] of each major culture is described, e.g. the [[w:particle physics standard model|particle physics standard model]] which serves as the [[w:particle physics foundation ontology|particle physics foundation ontology]] for other sciences, [[w:medieval Catholic foundation ontology|medieval Catholic foundation ontology]], [[w:classical Chinese foundation ontology|classical Chinese foundation ontology]], etc., and likewise for each [[w:cosmology|cosmology]].  Strong respect for the terms used in each culture brings the best scholars in the world here.  Constant effort keeps [[vocabulary]] manageable, and under 4000-5000 words for introductory articles - those with the shortest names.  The [[three billionth user]] comes to the wiki in 2007 with English as a second language, very little time and a low bandwidth connection, and walks away with the most useful description of an ecologically-sensitive garden they could possibly have got in that time...

===The History of Wikipedia===
Before Wikipedia was created, many people communicated by something known as the [[Internet]], which can be thought of as a primitive form of Wikipedia. However, the Internet had many severe limitations, such as the inability of anyone, other than the original author, to correct outdated information on the Internet. Also, it was often hard to find useful information.

At the time of Wikipedia’s creation, it was actually only a small part of the whole Internet.  It was originally intended to be an encyclopædia, where anyone could edit any information anytime. Although it is now hard for us to imagine that there could be a piece of information which people can't edit, at that time, it was actually a relatively new idea. Even so, editing was very limited in scope, time-intensive and required direct connection to the Internet. This information was divided into articles; each article had a different name, separating it from other discreet and seemingly unrelated articles. Links between articles were also added manually, and the content of these articles were further limited in scope since they could only contain text and pictures. To add to the general confusion, it was even possible for an individual contributor to accidentally add inconsistent or redundant information.

Despite these limitations, Wikipedia was by far the most effective system available, and therefore quickly became popular Internet destination for academics and researchers, as well as the general public. However, due to its free nature, Wikipedia met opposition in these early years from many large companies, which relied on [[patents]] and [[copyrights]] for profit. 

One such (then-megalithic) computer company, called [[Microsoft]], openly criticized Wikipedia and announced that they would not support Wikipedia. Soon after, they released a browser called Wikipedia Explorer.  Unfortunately, this release was already too late to prevent them from going out of business, since by then most people had already switched to Wikipedia-friendly operating systems such as [[Linux]], and using popular browsers, such as Wikera. 

Later, several other for-profit companies compiled a list of copyright violations and obtained a court order in an attempt to shut down Wikipedia. However, on the day of the trial in country known as the United States (US), [[wikipedians]] actually did shut down all US-based Wikipedia servers, and blocked all traffic between the US and other “foreign” Wikipedia servers. Ironically, with all of the US-based Wikipedia shut down, the court had no choice but to drop the case since they had no way to access the case files. Later that day, the US-based Wikipedia was then restored. To avoid similar embarrassment, all pending European court cases against Wikipedia were also dropped.

Equally ironic, a terrorist attack, considered to be the single largest simultaneous one in history, occurred on Wikipedia day in the same year Wikipedia was celebrating having replaced 90% of the Internet. Although no one was hurt directly by this action, all 375 major Wikipedia servers worldwide were simultaneously destroyed by time-delayed explosives. This simultaneous destruction of all major Wikipedia servers caused pings of up to 20 seconds, and most video and virtual reality interfaces failed due to lack of bandwidth. This left only about 700 major wikivision channels still broadcasting worldwide. 

In the wake of this tragic event, it has been estimated that tens of thousands of deaths resulted through cascading events; for instance, the crashing of public transport crashed, patients dying after their doctors were disconnected curing operations, as some hospitals still didn't even have their own wiki nodes. The biggest disruptions were in the third-world countries, large parts of which still had to connect to Wikipedia via the Internet. It took several days before all Wikipedia servers had been replaced. Thankfully, all vital facilities, without exception, had minor Wikipedia servers, or at least several wiki nodes, installed. As a safety precaution against the reoccurrence of similar events in the future, several million medium-capacity Wikipedia servers were built worldwide.

Many breakthroughs in Wikipedia protocol research have since been developed, allowing easier communication with Wikipedia and increasing the rate of adoption and learning of Wikipedia. Dolphins could communicate with Wikipedia hundreds of times faster than before. More importantly, Wikipedia was also adapted to the rather confusing human brain waves in addition to the much more clearly focused dolphin brain waves, which then allowed humans to communicate directly with Wikipedia.

With these stellar breakthroughs in Wikipedia protocol research, researchers set Wikipedia to analyze space for possible signals from [[extraterrestrial life]]. Surprisingly, they found signals coming from within our solar system, which turned out to be from an alien [[satellite]]. Since humanity created Wikipedia, it then had to consider humanity as an intelligent life form, qualifying humans for the basic rights of all civilizations in the universe. It was at this juncture that the human-created part of Wikipedia combined with the universal Wikipedia and, as such, became an intelligent creature imbued with all knowledge in the known universe. Soon after this, humans and dolphins were then acknowledged as valued members of the cosmic community and granted all the rights we are accustomed to today, such as the right to visit all the many civilizations and places in the universe and the right to eat unlimited amounts of chocolate ice-cream on Thursdays.

Wow.  And what is cool is that someone *really believes that* since it is not in [[visions]] where we put things we don't believe yet.  Isn't that inspiring?

Ideally, constant effort keeps '''vocabulary''' manageable for the casual user, and under 4000-5000 words for introductory articles - those with the shortest names. The [[three billionth user]] comes to the wiki in 2007 with English as a second language, very little time and a low bandwidth connection, and walks away with the most useful description of an ecologically-sensitive garden they could possibly have got in that time... 

What's wrong with this picture? What realistically can we do about overly complex vocabulary? It takes 1900 words to define the 4000 most common English [[w:idioms]] - so what are the [[worst cases]] regarding vocabulary creep? How big can we let it get? Highly educated people in the world tend to have at most 15,000 word vocabularies - how to handle profession jargons?

Most importantly, how to keep a [[concordance]] that shows us how meanings are evolving?
----

Please be aware of http://simple.wikipedia.com/ , the &quot;Simplified English&quot; version.
Perhaps we should send your 3 billionth user there.
----
For technical jargon, they should be definied within the context of the article. People more or less just do this naturally. And the rest, dictionaries are easily accesible. 

If you want to see why vocabulary creep is not a problem, check out the Oxford English Dictionary. There is a whole lot of words in there, but many of them are never used. They just drift out of the language by themselves.

----
My initial thought is that as articles get deep or detailed in technical or overly lofty language often used by specialists or people intimately familiar with the subject that an attempt to write a simplied overview to introduce the article or this could move to a separate article or wikipedia and referenced/linked.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Worst cases''' are bad.  They are very bad. They are, by definition, as bad as cases can get. There are no cases that are more bad than the worst ones.

They are not so bad that you don't believe they could happen, though &amp;mdash; things so bad you don't believe in them yourself are [[threats]].  A worst case is something you can quantify in terms of wasted time, wasted effort, failed [[visions]] and many frustrated attempts to reach [[best cases]], which seem to be working and then just fail.

The [[status quo]] should be stated in terms of these worst cases first and foremost - the worst form a kind of reporting language in which you can talk about what's going on, commiserate, and find a [[w:basis of unity|basis of unity]] on which to go drink beer.  Remember - people look at the [[status quo]] report not to satisfy themselves that &quot;things are fine&quot; but rather to find more stuff to complain about.  So help them.  It all starts here by listing worst cases:

==Internal==
''These cases result from the failure of the Wikipedia community.  We can mitigate their effects or prevent them altogether.''

===Tunnel vision===

====The encyclopedia that Slashdot built====
A small editorial clique based in academia always dominates the wikipedia - it never really manages to deal with clandestine literature that's kept off the web, fast-proliferating terminology, populist challenges to academic bias, or fully escape a &quot;mathematics and physics centric&quot; view of the world.  [[w:neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]] becomes a shallow convention, and self-appointed censors shred everything that disagrees with their own [[w:cosmology|cosmology]] daily.  Talented people avoid wiki, figuring it has no real [[value system]].  The [[three billionth user]] never arrives.

====Two worlds====
The [[board]] consists only of traditional academics and librarians and a few eager technologists.  They express little interest in innovative [[funding]] methods, and none in refining the [[ontology]] or understanding [[community]] problems that are holding back the project.  They permit the [[IP Death Squad]] to define &quot;[[vandalism]]&quot;, limit [[edit wars]], and patrol for copyright risk, and no effective control over these activities is ever exercised.  The Wikipedia has a mind/body division for board/sysops, in a permanent coma or sleepwalking, with the 'mind' unable to exercise any control over the 'body'. 

The size of the Wikipedia stabilizes, but its quality rather sharply declines as other projects (with or without the GFDL) copy the projects' most effective attributes and ignore its mistakes.  A responsible board is recruited for these other projects, but it must fork the database and jettison Wikipedia policies.  Wikipedia is effectively dead.

====Permanent mediocrity====
As Wikipedia grows, the overall quality of its content deteriorates.  Increasingly it resembles a sea of words that feign [[w:information|information]] while offering little objective [[w:truth|truth]], breaking on the shores of islands of [[w:fact|fact]]ually correct but [[w:education|education]]ally useless technical information.  Due to the encyclopedia's [[w:Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|size]] and [[w:exponential growth|growth]], more and more dubious &quot;information&quot; in the sea will escape the attention it needs, and the average article will become an unreliable collection of poorly supported facts, inaccuracies, distortions, opinions, and fringe views, indistinguishable from each other.  The sea is marred by a wandering blemish of [[vandalism]] and [[POV]] reflecting the [[w:zeitgeist|zeitgeist]] of [[w:popular culture|popular culture]].  The islands remain in their pristine [[w:ivory tower|faux-ivory]] forms unchanged for indefinite lengths of time, too thinly scattered, too dry, and of too limited interest to attract attention, for good or ill.  It is an [[w:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]], but of what use to its [[w:student|readers]]?

===Majority rule===
====Original research====
Some users see Wikipedia as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. They push their agendas and non-standard terminologies, infesting articles all over the place with half-baked pet theories.

====Hostile newbies====
People jump into Wikipedia without trying to understand the community that has built up around it or the goals the community has set. They refuse to work with others unless they get to set the terms. They make threats to call in like-minded friends to force their particular agendas, taking advantage of Wikipedia's open participation policy.

====Tyranny of the majority====
Authors think more about what they ''can'' do, rather than what they ''should'' do. More and more disputes are resolved by [[edit wars]] of attrition. Articles end up being written not from a neutral point of view that is acceptable to almost all ''readers'', but from a partisan point of view that is considered ideal to 51% of the ''editors''. Attempts to resolve such issues by enlarging space are stymmied by the desire to avoid duplication. The victorious majority see no reason to collaborate with the minority, and indeed see such collaboration as &quot;defeat&quot;.

===Minority rule===

====Elitist goons====
Mild examples of any or all of the above serve as excuses for the various elitist goons composing the [[IP Death Squad]] to assume their own virtue exceeds that of their foes.  A small group captures [[sysop]] privileges and bans all those with varying views.  No [[Wikimedia:Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] structure evolves to put limits on such activities, and &quot;little tin god syndrome&quot; enables a small group of technologists to control what is or is not expressed in the [[Wikipedia]].  No [[funding]] arrives, due in part to the impossibility of guaranteeing respect for notable talents that would attract it.  Wikipedia degrades from an encyclopedia to a big weblog.

====Use of force against demonstrators====
Sysops and founders use force against demonstrators, claiming &quot;cybercrime&quot; includes responding to the invitation &quot;Anyone, including ''you'' can edit an article now&quot; after an admin attempts to selectively exclude some writers. While claiming anyone can contribute, sysops and founders gradually establish who is part of &quot;anyone&quot; and who is not. Disillusioned with being excluded from the meta-human category of &quot;anyone&quot;, contributors who sysops have banned decide it is legitimate to protest the actions of dehumanizing sysops. They contribute strictly benign or otherwise relevant political information to articles in flagrant violation of the ban, laying the foundation in the event of a criminal court case. Eventually, sysops succeed in recruiting law enforcement assistance, who conduct a series of early morning armed raids on writers who sysops have banned. One banned writer is suprised when police commit raids and is accidentally killed when local rookie police officer thinks suspect is armed. Jimbo gets world wide reputation for using lethal force against educational and political writers. In court, the criminal suspects disclose the genuinely educational material they contributed as &quot;cybercriminals&quot; leaving sysops and founders to appear as censors. Media feeds on stories of Wikipedia supressing free speech. Suspects file civil suit, alleging entrapment by sysops. Founder appears on media claiming use of force was justified to protect his project from criminals.

===Overspecialization===

====Catering to sifters====
The [[sifter]] becomes the primary consumer of the project, leading to a proliferation of specialist versions which are rubber-stamped by one group or another.  These grow steadily distinct, as less effort goes into stabilizing the most common concepts' articles, and more effort goes into specialist 'terms of art', incomprehensible even to practitioners of a closely related discipline.  Academic ossification sets in, and nothing that attempts to integrate or cross-examine multiple fields of study from an ethical point of view, nor from an under-represented group's point of view, can break through the academic [[en:groupthink|groupthink]] that asserts only its own values:  knowledge as a universal positive good, academic reputation as a reliable way to gauge trust, challenge to non-academic knowledge as some kind of [[troll]].

The size of the Wikipedia grows exponentially, and integration of multiple points of view into comprehensive articles that say new things is very rare.  Wikipedia becomes like the web itself, an easy way to get cheap backup for any foolish thing one might say, as long as it's said in obscure enough language.

====Western imperialism====
American editors take over the control of Wikipedia, with no reaction whatsoever of other english-speaking editors.  They manage to delete every comment and article scratching the pride of America, and stuff the encyclopedia with numerous articles deriding those who dare disagreeing with the U.S.

Wikipedia goes on growing, but non-american editors participation drop. Wikipedia is widely considered as another US [[propaganda]] tool, and ends being a biased tool read only by american and pro-america users. 

One case being the notoriously pollution-friendly views of the US government(not just Bush, but the issues that went ignored without interruption over the generation).

It is notoriously impossible for example to convince enough wikipedians raised in english not to always delete as &quot;obviously some nutcase - no need to check his links&quot; some information about the USA's various 'completely safe' pollutions that are banned in the rest of the world as 'highly toxic' or 'banned - no safety data'. People aren't willing to even let the highly verifiable &quot;country X banned product Y&quot; listed under some issues that are taken for granted. So USA propaganda issues and pollution are put into the most favorable light possible, lying by omission of every other view.

This isn't a USA-unique trend, nor is it strongest in the USA; wikipedia in other languages have their own cultural dogma and the idea that the dogma might be false doesn't strike everybody so opposing ideas are deleted without hesitation or verification. People part of that culture that realise the dogma is false don't add it back because it isn't *their* edit war. They let someone who has much more time and social respectability than them to lose do it!

For some issues, it's whoever spends the most time deleting other POV or the NPOV who win and adding content can't help you against those people(This would occur even without the NPOV rule). USA obviously has more wikipedians united on some issues than the rest of the english world so of course their dogma has more hold on wikipedia than any other country's dogma...
