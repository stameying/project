IBM IN DUBLIN (OH)
 
From: ugadvising-request@cse.ohio-state.edu [mailto:ugadvising-request@cse.ohio-state.edu] On Behalf Of Andrew Pang
Sent: Friday, May 31, 2013 12:10 PM
Subject: Software Development positions @ IBM
 
We have corresponded a few times in the past on other positions I had open @ the IBM location in Dublin, OH.

I'm looking for guidance on attracting any OSU students for a few positions open for those with graduation dates up to Dec 2013.   

Software Solutions Developer (25249130)
https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/faces/job_summary?job_id=SWG-0540726

User Experience Professional (25250962)
https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/faces/job_summary?job_id=SWG-0579901

I have posted them on the OSU career website.  The first one has been posted for a few months, but I haven't received as much traction as I would like.  Out of the two that had applied, I did make an offer to one and will be bringing on-board in July.  I do believe there are interested qualified students out there, but I'm wondering if I have done enough to draw attention to the openings. 

If there are any on-campus visits or other methods to communicate, let me know and I will take advantage of them. 

Thanks,

Andy

s. F-1 and J-1 students and their dependents, as well as other non-immigrants, will no longer be issued a paper Form I-94 - the small white card stapled into the passport - when entering the U.S. Passports will still be stamped at the port of entry, showing the date and place of entry, non-immigrant status and the "admitted to" notation (D/S).
  
This information is recorded electronically by Customs and Border Protection, but instead of being given an I-94 at the time of entry, you will later be able to print the form yourself from the Customs and Border Protection website. When departing from the U.S., you should still plan to hand in your current paper I-94 card.
 
The Office of International Affairs will provide additional information about this change in the coming months. Read more about these changes at the Customs and Border Protection website. 
Summer term information and requirements
 
All F-1 and J-1 students are allowed one period of "vacation" per year, during summer term (which includes May session). As long as you are not in your first or final term, you will automatically be granted a vacation term for summer, and it is not necessary to report a vacation request to the Office of International Affairs. Please be aware that full-time enrollment is required during all autumn and spring semesters. If you have any questions, please contact an immigration coordinator.   
OPT and CPT workshops 

Optional practical training (OPT) provides hands-on practical work experience that is directly related to a student's major area of study. OPT is authorized by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a maximum of 12 months, and is available to students who have been enrolled on a full-time basis for at least one academic year (nine months). 

Temporary employment such as an internship, practicum and alternative work-study or cooperative education may be authorized as curricular practical training (CPT). CPT must not only be related to your major field of study but must also be an integral part of your established curriculum still in progress. These workshops, which will take place throughout the summer, will help you understand eligibility and application procedures. All workshops will take place in 122 Oxley Hall.

Important updates from The Ohio State University
 
MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT GEE
 
Dear Friends and Colleagues:
I write to let you know that today I am announcing my retirement from Ohio State, effective July 1. Without question, the University has achieved remarkable success, and it has been my honor and calling to lead it. Ohio State is well-positioned for the future. I love this University, and my relationship with it will continue.
Sincerely,
E. Gordon Gee
President E. Gordon Gee Announces Retirement from Presidency
E. Gordon Gee, President of The Ohio State University, and Robert H. Schottenstein, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Ohio State University, announced today that Dr. Gee plans to retire from the presidency, effective July 1.
Executive Vice President and Provost Joseph A. Alutto will be named Interim President. Dr. Alutto previously served as Interim President in 2007.
President Gee served as Ohio State's president for two terms, from 1990-1997 and 2007 to present. During his tenure as President, Dr. Gee has been an extraordinary leader of Ohio State. He has enhanced the University's academic profile as Ohio State has become a highly selective, top-tier public research institution. His leadership has contributed significantly to the strengthening of the University's long-term financial condition, highlighted by his recent efforts to help raise more than $1.6 billion in private support. Widely known throughout Ohio and around the country, President Gee also recently chaired a national commission on the future of higher education. At the request of Ohio Governor John Kasich, President Gee also spearheaded two state commissions that developed new models for funding public higher education.
"I recently returned from a vacation with my family, during which time I had a chance to consider the University's phenomenal achievements and the road that lies ahead for it. Ohio State now has a richness of new opportunities that would be the envy of most universities. During my days away, I also spent some time in self-reflection. And after much deliberation, I have decided it is now time for me to turn over the reins of leadership to allow the seeds that we have planted to grow. It is also time for me to reenergize and refocus myself," said President Gee.
"I began my career at Ohio State in 1990, and I was honored to return as its leader six years ago. I am proud to have played a critical role in the university's transformation from excellence to eminence. I plan to work closely with the Trustees and Dr. Alutto to ensure the smoothest transition possible. I cannot express enough my deep appreciation to the people of Ohio for the opportunity they have given me to lead this great University. I love this University, and although I might be retiring from the presidency, my work with Ohio State will continue. No matter what the future may hold for me, Ohio is my home," concluded President Gee.
Chairman Schottenstein said: "Dr. Gee and I met this morning, and he informed me of his decision to retire. By any measure, Gordon has been a transformational leader for Ohio State. His service to Ohio State has been superb. This man has been an inspiration to many people, including me, and we all are forever grateful for his friendship. His thoughtful and unique leadership style has taken the University to new levels. His engagement with the entire Ohio State community is truly remarkable. Clearly he leaves a rich and lasting legacy and will be missed. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our profound gratitude to President Gee for his service to The Ohio State University. As we go forward, the University Board will work in close partnership with Dr. Gee and Dr. Alutto through this period to continue the tremendous success and growth we have seen under his leadership."
As The Ohio State University's chief academic officer, Executive Vice President and Provost Joseph A. Alutto has been responsible for the administration, coordination, and development of all academic functions of the university. He held the John W. Berry Sr. Chair in Business in the Fisher College of Business, where he served as dean for the 16 years prior to his appointment as executive vice president and provost. Dr. Alutto was dean of the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Management for 14 years before his arrival at Ohio State in 1991.
Details about the search for a new president will be forthcoming.

Dear  MAE, ECE and Engineering Physics students,
 
I’m contacting you to let you know about a special independent study course on Nuclear Power Plant operations that I’m offering this summer term. We will be using OSU’s new digital nuclear power plant simulator to study NPP systems and NPP operations. You’ll get a chance to learn how to operate a commercial NPP on the full-scale simulator. 
 
This is a great opportunity if you're interested in nuclear power or if you've thought about completing the Nuclear Engineering minor. The minor is 2 required courses + 2 electives; this course counts as one of the electives.
 
The class schedule is still to be determined, but we will meet for 3 hours twice a week in June and July, probably Tues/Thurs afternoons. The independent study is 3 credit hours, and it is graded A-E.
 
We are also hoping to run a short experiment about NPP operators following the course. You will be eligible to participate if you successfully complete the course. Participants will be awarded $150.
 
If you are around this summer and interested in being part of the summer NPP operations course, or if you have questions, please contact Rachel Benish, benish.6@osu.edu by 5pm this Wednesday (June 5).  Sorry about the quick turnaround time--we need to start the class next week!
 
We’re looking forward to working with you this summer,
 
Best,
 
Dr. Carol Smidts
Professor, Nuclear Engineering

OSU STAR House serves homeless youth
Arising from a research grant, and in response to the lack of targeted services available in Central Ohio for homeless youth, the STAR House, a drop-in center for homeless youth, was opened in October 2006. Homeless youth are one of the most vulnerable populations in the world. These youth avoid services and are at risk for victimization and chronic homelessness well into adulthood. The STAR House serves between 20 to 40 homeless youth each day and its mission is to provide homeless youth a safe respite from the streets where they are able to meet their basic needs and begin reconnecting with the larger social system. To learn more about the OSU STAR House, please contact Jeana Patterson at patterson.597@osu.edu or visit www.osustarhouse.com.
The Commit to our Communities feature is published to highlight your stories about the many service and outreach activities the university is involved in. Send items to be considered for publication to gammage.2@osu.edu. Limit text to 125 words and include contact information, a web link and a photo if applicable.

Hi Nikki,
 
I am working right now to get something you can post around in the CSE department but right now I am looking for someone to do a quick KeyBank Printer Job in Westerville.  This would be perfect for students who stayed around in Columbus and just have part time jobs or for the students that help in the CSE lab.
 
 
We are looking for a student in the Columbus area to go to a Keybank location and set up their new network printer.  The day is next week, May 15th.  They are to go to the Keybank location at 51 West Schrock Rd in Westerville at 9am.  It should take maybe about 2 hours if that.  They will get a script and all the instructions of course.   The pay is $27 for the job.  It is a 1099 Form so we don’t take any taxes.  The company they are contracting for is CompuCom which is a great company to get some experience with and a foot in the door.  Could you send this out to students for me and have them get in touch with me at:

We do all types of recruiting from contracts ti perm and all the way from help desk type of people to high end Web developers. I don't know if you can but you can spread my contact info around to recent grads or current cse students. There are a lot of short term projects all over the US that can help out cse students with the experience part of their resume. I want to give back to osu and help out fellow osu cse grads and students as much as I can. Thanks!

Defining success at Ohio State
Kinshuk Mitra, a Biomedical Engineering junior, admits his GPA is suffering because of the organized chaos consuming his life. But he wouldn’t have it any other way. In addition to classwork, studying and the multiple research papers he’s penning, Mitra is launching a company this month, OncoFilter, based on new technology he developed that captures multiple types of tumor cells in a single device. The idea is to create a robust and more effective way to detect cancer, earlier than current tests allow, which increases the survival rate of those diagnosed with the disease.

OSU students bring creativity, technology and outreach together
As part of the Ghana Sustainable Change program, Charisma Acey and Jamie Greene led a group of Ohio State students to Ghana to participate in a collaboration between OSU City and Regional Planning, the Department of Planning at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and the Offinso North District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana.  
Ohio State students implemented a collection of projects from solar panel installation (shown here) to iPad data collection to support resource allocation and long-term planning in the community. The OSU team received a 2012 BETHA grant, which enabled students to collaborate with the district in the design of sustainable development solutions tied to local priorities for development, combining creativity, technology and outreach in one project.

To:      Ramnath, Rajiv <ramnath@cse.ohio-state.edu>



Say Rajiv,

I got one student for that “Hack my Ride” (Cyber Auto) competition (flyer and registration attached).  I now need one OSU undergrad – top notch, hacker mentality with integrity beyond reproach who would be interested in this week-long event.  I even have housing/meals to offer, should the person not be local and need these accommodations.  And it is absolutely without cost to the participant- with significant career launching potential due to the high powered people in both government and industry who will be working alongside them.

Do you have someone you would heartily recommend?  If so, would you have them return the attached registration form (filled out and scanned in) to me?

Thanks!

Hello Dr. Strader,
 
Please forward on this job description to the members of the mailing list. Thank you!
Do you enjoy coding in your spare time? Maybe you enjoy creating apps for Android or Apple devices, or you might host a website or server. Maybe you just like to mess around with hardware and create new gadgets. If any of these things interest you, or you simply have a passion for software development, TeamDynamix may be the place for you.
We are a web-based development company headquartered in Columbus, within ten minutes of OSU’s main campus. We provide solutions to project portfolio management software for Higher Education. Our software is currently being used by some of the leading educational institutions in North America, including Texas A&M University, Florida State University, Syracuse University, and The Ohio State University.
We constantly encourage each other’s development in a very relaxed office environment. There are no cubicles, simply an open office with top-of-the-line computers and multiple monitors. Included in this office is a great community, where all developers help each other out and work together. Outside of the workplace, there are department lunches and office events to relax. In the office, relax by bringing your finest Nerf gun collection, and join in the fun.
The development is fast-paced and challenging, but you will always have support in getting your projects finished. Right from the start, you will be assigned to a project team and begin working on site development, not just experimental work. We are looking for upcoming graduates from OSU to work in .NET development.
If this seems like the place for you, we encourage you to contact us! Selected candidates will be invited to meet the team and see the office in action. When we have openings, they are filled quickly, so apply now!
Required:
·         Must be eligible to work for any employer in the U.S. without sponsorship
·         Minimum 3.3 GPA
·         Degree in Computer Engineering (for example CSE or CIS)
·         Highly motivated, always willing to learn and expand your horizons
Please send your resume to newcareers@teamdynamixhe.com for immediate consideration.

Important updates from The Ohio State University
 
MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT GEE
 
 
Dear Students and Parents:
As the school year comes to a close -- our first on the semester system in 90 years -- I write to share some thoughts.
Recent events around the country have tested our collective confidence. At times, our campus community has been challenged as well. I am proud to say that our campus and our country stand strong.
I also want to assure you that the safety of our students and the University community remains our utmost priority. And I want to make this point: Our University will not be deterred from its central mission of teaching and learning.
We are the most vital and intellectually vibrant university in the country. A few highlights of the year:
Visitors to campus included photographer Annie Leibovitz, President Barack Obama, animal advocate Jane Goodall, Pulitzer-Prize winning author Junot Diaz, and energy expert Daniel Yergin.
More than 700 students shared their research in everything from alternative energy to zoology at the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum.
Students devoted more than one million hours of community service -- from dancing all night for cancer research to spending Spring Break building homes for families in need .
And, on May 5, nearly 10,000 students will receive their diplomas in Ohio Stadium and become the next generation of teachers and artists and engineers. In the words of one graduate: "We are not afraid of the challenges of the future. We welcome them."
From my second-floor window, I have a unique vantage point to see across the Oval, the physical heart of the University. It is an inspiring view, a mosaic of people and cultures, framed by promise and possibility. And I am certain that the spirit and optimism of these students will guide us to a bright future.
I hope your view this Spring is as uplifting as my own.
Sincerely,
E. Gordon Gee
President

What is Pelotonia?  What is Team Buckeye?
Pelotonia is a grassroots bike tour with one goal: to end cancer.
In its first four years, Pelotonia has raised more than $42 million for innovative and life saving cancer research at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute. Driven by the passion of its riders, virtual riders, volunteers as well as their families and friends, Pelotonia's annual cycling experience is a place of hope, energy and determination. It is a community of people coming together with one goal:  end cancer.
Team Buckeye is a “super-peloton” incorporating all pelotons associated with The Ohio State University including teams formed by faculty, staff, students, alumni and Buckeye fans from near and far!  Team Buckeye made its debut in 2011 with Ohio State's very own Archie Griffin leading the charge as Honorary Captain.  In 2012 Shelley Meyer joined Archie as Co-Captain for Team Buckeye and together they led 1,635 Team Buckeye members in raising nearly $2.2M of the $16.8M raised in Pelotonia 12.  This year, Honorary Captain Shelley Meyer is joined by former OSU football great Craig Krenzel in leading Team Buckeye during Pelotonia 13.
Karl Koon, Director of Development and Rider Recruitment for Team Buckeye, a Development Officer for The James, and Dean Williams will be at E100 Scott Lab at 12:00pm on Friday, April 26, 2013 to share information on how you can participate in Pelotonia 13.  The presentation will include:

Tomorrow morning, 4/24, at 7:00 AM we will be rolling our connection to
the University network over to a new fiber run. This should be a very
brief network interruption, less than a minute.

The new run was tested by the OCIO today and found to be within industry
specs so we don't anticipate any issues. If there was a problem we could
roll back to the old fiber.

Thanks,
Dave

Date: April 22, 2013 2:01:57 PM EDT
To: "'weide@cse.ohio-state.edu'" <weide@cse.ohio-state.edu>

Hello Professor Weide,
I am emailing from a company called GradStaff.   We have placed recent graduates throughout the United States. I am so sorry to take up your time. I wanted to share a Programmer opportunity we are recruiting for that might be a good fit for a recent college grad with a background in Computer Science/Information Systems.
 
GradStaff provides employment services focusing exclusively on a unique labor pool – the recent college graduate. Using our proprietary interviewing technique, we invest a considerable amount of time getting to know each candidate and understanding their core skills and attributes. In understanding our candidates better, we then identify exciting employment opportunities that help them combat the often-frustrating “Catch-22” of needing experience, but not finding a job where they can gain that experience.
We place our candidates in a variety of different areas: Banking, Benefit Administration, IT, Electronics,  Customer Service/Sales, Financial Services, Human Resources, Insurance, Marketing, Operations and Retail Operations. All costs for our services are paid for by our client companies – graduates who apply with Gradstaff NEVER pay us a fee.
 
As I mentioned, we are currently recruiting for a Programmer position with a company called Sedgwick in Hilliard, OH.  They treat their employees extremely well and are firm believers in training people fresh out of college from the ground up. The best candidate will have working knowledge of :
PL/SQL or SQL derivative
UNIX operating system
Data structures and algorithms
Database Management
IT Infrastructure
Application Programming
Please feel free to pass the position on to graduating seniors or alumni who you feel might still be looking for a full time opportunity.
 
I appreciate any help or advice you can provide.
 
If you should have any questions please do not hesitate in contacting me through email or phone at 612-600-7473 ormqueenan@gradstaff.com. 
 
 
Thank you for your time!
